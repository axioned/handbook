This document is intended to help new members get up to speed with the project and the team. It is also intended to help the team get to know the new member and their strenghts and focus areas.

## For time-sensitive handovers

- Identify the new member
- Layout and communicate internal the onboarding and the communication plan (with timelines)
- Training period (2 weeks)
- Introduce to the client (ideally on a call) and communicate the onboarding plan (with timelines)
- Overlap period (1-2 weeks) where the **new person is doing the actual work** (~30% of the work) and the **previous person is reviewing and doing the rest** (~70% of the actual work)
  - 1-2 internal review checkpoints
- Get feedback from the client (in around 2 weeks from the start of the overlap period)
  - Manage the feedback loop
- Complete the transition and confirmation

:::tip In the overlap period
The new member should be doing the actual work, not just shadowing the previous person.

:::danger Important
Step back and really think about the communication plan. **It is as much as about technical onboarding as it is about communication with the client.**

## For non-time-sensitive handovers

The same as above, but without the time pressure.
