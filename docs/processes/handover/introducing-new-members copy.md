This document is intended to help new members get up to speed with a new project and team. It is also intended to help the client and team get to know the new member, their strenghts and focus areas.

## For time-sensitive handovers

- Identify the new member
- Layout and communicate internally (preferably formally via email) the onboarding and the communication plan (with timelines)
- Training period (2 weeks)
- Introduction call: Introduce to the client (ideally on a call) and communicate the high-level onboarding plan - e.g. "today we just wanted to make introductions; we'll follow-up with the plan and timelines on email"
- Directly post introduction call: Layout and communicate to the client (formally via email) the introduction and onboarding plan with timelines. Ensure the email is concise, speciifc and elicit's confidence in our onboarding plan.
- Overlap period (1-2 weeks) where the **new person is doing the actual work** (~30% of the work) and the **previous person is reviewing and doing the rest** (~70% of the actual work)
  - 1-2 internal review checkpoints
- Get feedback from the client (in around 2 weeks from the start of the overlap period)
  - Manage the feedback loop
- Complete the transition and confirmation

:::tip In the overlap period
The new member should be doing the actual work, not just shadowing the previous person.

:::danger Important
Step back and really think about the communication plan. **It is as much as about technical onboarding as it is about communication with the client.**

## For non-time-sensitive handovers

The same as above, but without the time pressure.
