  - The access to WPEngine will be limited to Oversee or a senior dev.
  - Consider Server access credentials in a separate document not in a common credential document and keep limited member access.
  - Always recommend to create a back-up before proceeding with major activities/deployment also this should be done under Oversee supervision.
  - Since the site is built using theme builder it's recommended that when there is a complex ticket developer should take notes whatever changes he performs in case anything goes wrong it can be reverted easily.
  - It's recommended to enable the Revision feature from WordPress minimum 5 Revisions to be there.
  - If there is test and try or any debugging is required on live site please do not proceed directly on the live pages it's recommended that to create a duplicate of on which the trail needs to be done and also make sure that duplicate page shouldn't be crawled or indexed add “noindex nofollow” for a time being.
    - After all the testing is done, please make sure that you trash that page completely.
    - Note: Do not make a duplicate page as a live version as there is a history attached with it else it will be lost.
  - Please check if your sites have a History plugin or not, to get a detailed update of user activity.
  - Give clear instructions to developers, that if they want to make any changes related to global setting, please reach out to Senior dev or Oversee once to be double sure for that particular task.
