# Overview

WordPress is a way to create websites in an open-source, modular ecosystem. It’s known as a Content Management System (CMS), which means you get an intuitive way to create and manage your posts and pages of your website. It comes full-featured out of the box, but is also extendable. There are two ways to do this:

- **Themes** – These dictate the look of your site, although some also provide extra functionality.
- **Plugins** – This is how you extend the functionality of your site, and the plugin ecosystem is huge. You’ll be able to find a plugin for any practical application and might need.

Since WordPress is an open-source platform, you’re also able to develop your site using any coding skills you have. In other words, its full code is available to view and download for free, and contributors across the globe keep improving the offering. You’re also able to use WordPress for any purpose.
