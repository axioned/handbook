# Communication Guidelines

Any reason +seemam@prdxn.com or +akanshab@prdxn.com Why this wouldn't refer to email templates we've pre-written? In this folder? https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B7Jc9G9bAqHGdU9teG5VLW1FSzA And if these are out of date, why wouldn't we revise/edit/delete them as needed?

**Tips for writing effective emails**

---
1. Get Grammar and spelling right
1. Brief subject lines (refer point 12 re subject lines)
1. Use bullets in email content to make your content more readable
1. Try and logically divide the email into smaller sections and have a bold heading for each section.
1. Highlighting issues
   1. Always [highlight key issues](https://www.techno-pm.com/2015/07/issues-register-template-excel-free-download.html) with either making the text bold or highlight in color.
   1. When mentioning an issue in the email always mention the impact it has on the project or task.
   1. It is good to be proactive and also mention the different solutions for the highlighted issue.
1. It is always good to talk to the person before sending a controversial or surprising email.
1. Wait for sometime before sending an email
   1. This is applicable when you are sending an escalation or a complaint.
   1. Always avoid sending emails when you are angry or annoyed with something.
1. Include a picture or snapshot when possible.
1. Document all the assumptions
   1. Make sure you document all the assumptions you have made when sending the email.
   1. This is especially true when you publish project plans or key project dates.
   1. Clearly, state all the assumptions under a single heading like "Assumptions" at the end of the email.
1. When sending an email to which you need a response make sure you give an accurate date and time by which you need a response.
1. Please be prepared to communicate - for each review round/input you need from the client - specific expectations that you have - well in advance so they can schedule their day around it. *e.g. telling them the day before isn't considerate of a day/schedule they might already have planned.*
   1. The sooner you can communicate these expectations, based on what you know/are aware of, the better
   1. If you need more answers from (your team members) in order to be able to do, then i'm assuming you'll coordinate/get those answers well in advance
1. Subject- Use Project name/ Project code. E.g. "HomeServe and PRDXN call" replace with "HS-USA: Jamstack POC & PRDXN call".
1. While referring to date/time, always mention the client’s  timezone. In case there are stakeholders belonging to more than one timezone, make sure to convert and mention the date/time as per multiple timezones as applicable.
   1. Tools- Either google “when it's x am in new york what is is in singapore? Or use  [http://www.fioapp.co](http://www.fioapp.co/)
   1. E.g.: 

Hi [names],

To clarify expectations for feedback round 1:

1, We will send you [what you're sending] via [how you're sending it] by [date/client's timezone time]

2, You'll have between [date/client's timezone time] and [date/client's timezone time] to give feedback

3, We'd prefer you to give feedback via [specify where you'd like them to input/give feedback in a manner that works for the team that needs to act on this feedback]

(replace everything in brackets with real data)

1. Always read your emails before hitting the send button.
1. Further details re “PRDXN\_RULE FOR WRITING EMAILS” can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iUoNqS7EH2_w7XTU6BHta_OXEZSg1X7MzX18bJB8sXo/edit).

## **Acknowledging Emails**

**Why to acknowledge:** 

1. When people send email, they wish to receive a reply or acknowledgement, or else they get unsure whether their email has been received and read by the recipient or not.  
1. Acknowledgement re-assures the sender that not only has the email been successfully sent, but that you are aware of its contents. This shifts responsibility from the sender to the recipient .
1. If an acknowledgement email is sent quickly, it suggests that as a recipient, you are both available and quick in managing requests, thus nurturing trust between both parties.
1. Acknowledgment lets the email sender know that his or her request has already begun to be processed, even if you are not actually in a position to provide an ETA [Estimated Time of Arrival] in your email. 
1. This can actually gain you time overall as it re-assures the sender that the appropriate parties have been made aware of the request, and that no concerns have yet been raised.

Note- Also refer- [PRDXN_IMMEDIATE RESPONSE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p7ZmM2ZviT1v8Xeqys7lxdRsy05p-_t_dETqrqUrLn0/edit)

**Ideal time to acknowledge:**


1. Such emails should be sent quickly. You may wish to respond within 1 to 24 hours. A good rule of thumb is to respond on the same day as the initial request.
1. At PRDXN as we work across different time zones the following may work best for us:
   1. Any email hitting the inbox between 11 am till 9 pm IST will be acknowledged within 2 hr of receipt.
   1. Any email hitting the inbox after 9 pm IST will be acknowledged before 1 pm the following day.
      1. The time frame is an indicator. PMs should be able to make smart decisions on what to prioritize when, keeping in mind that we don't keep the client waiting for long so as to make him ask for an update.     

**What the acknowledgement email should consist of:**


1. The acknowledgment email should set expectation re next steps/timeline even if you are not in position to commit to an actual ETA (ie. “I’ll get back to you by today evening EST”).
1. If you are not in a position to read the email thoroughly before sending an acknowledgment, it is absolutely acceptable to indicate this with a message of the type “Well received. [Our team / I] will review this carefully as soon as possible and circle back with any questions.”
1. Follow up on the request in a timely manner, even if it’s only to provide an update or a firmer ETA. The acknowledgement email will lose all value over time if you do not back it up with actual content. Make it your aim to follow up with the sender before he or she has a chance to follow up with you on the request.

**Sharing Plan/Timeline**

---
## **Why to share Plan/Timeline**

Client Stakeholders need to see the bigger picture. Sharing the initial Plan/Timeline will lessen client’s anxiety about the Project. This plan/timeline can be considered as the base to track progress. During the course of project execution.

## **Status Update Reports/Emails:**

### **Why Status Reports are important:**

1. Status reports guarantee that you have a constant information flow. It allows you to manage and communicate with your stakeholders more effectively. 
1. Stakeholders are always anxious to know how the project is doing, so keeping them in the loop via regular status reports will increase their confidence in the project manager and the project. 
1. It’s better to communicate potential or real issues and challenges with them as soon as they arise**.**

**Frequency of Status Reports:**

The frequency of of status reports can be determined by the following factors

1. Duration of the project
1. Nature of project (Complex vs simple)
1. Needs of stakeholders- frequency can be agreed with stakeholders as agreed during project kickoff meetings.

**Phase/Project Completion Report:**

---------------
**Why to send Phase/Project Completion:** 


1. To make it official that the Phase/Project has been completed and that the next actions ( eg billing/invoice, warranty etc) can be initiated.


Hi [Client\_Name],

Below is a Phase Completion report for your review:

**Phase 1: Goals/Expectations** - 
**Phase 1: Final Results/Outcome -** 


**Variance Analysis:** 

- Planned hrs vs Actual hrs *(This is applicable if phase completion is sent internally not for client)*
- Planned timeline vs Actual timeline

**Risk Analysis:**


**Next Steps/Action items:**

Based on all the above points, we are good to take the next step (enter Phase 2/invoice/ warranty/ etc). Feel free to add any points you feel I have missed. 



### **Phase Completion Status Update Email - Internal/Client**
**Sample #1**

Hi [Client\_Name],

Hope you are doing well and keeping safe.

We have completed Phase 1 (Define & Prepare + Build Prep). With that, we have been able to firm up Phase 2, i.e., Build (Development), Integration, QA & Launch - the designs, deliverables, and most importantly, the technical approach.

Details regarding the implementation of Phase 2 can be found in the Final proposal document here which we have reviewed/discussed with you (we have addressed all your latest comments/suggestions in the document).

On the basis of several rounds of discussions and reviews on the functional requirements and technical approach - below is the revised Phase 2 timeline. I have outlined (in PS notes) some of the key changes/contributors for the increase in the timeline.

**Expected timeline for Phase 2**

Tentative start date: 12th April 2021

Go-live date: 26th July 2021

Estimated week: 13 weeks

I will follow up with the detailed WBS by April 8th.

Our Accounts team will reach out to you with an associated costing for the same by Today EOD.

Thanks and Regards,

[PM Name]

**PS.**

Below are the major factors contributing to the increase in the timeline.

- Reason 1
- Reason 2

## **Escalation Guidelines :** 
<https://sites.google.com/a/prdxn.com/wiki/home/a-must-read-for-all/escalation-guidelines?authuser=1>
## **Go Live Guidelines** 
1. Share email to client detailing the GoLive activities (see [sample email ](#_ihv636)below) 
1. Make sure the standard [Go live checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cUPn_q-UVkjk7pYfXySBg4E8qYF0HccN3_sVyRJiBnw/edit#gid=0) is taken care of.
1. Document and get sign off on pre go live checklist from the client.
1. Confirm team’s availability/planned leaves.
1. If migrating from an old site to a new one, make sure the latest data/content is fetched/up to date and licenses are transferred.
1. In case of migration, make sure any third party/old redirect/scripts are working properly as of old site.
1. Avoid going live on Fridays/a day before any public holidays/long weekends.
1. Avoid going live in the 2nd half (IST) unless it's critical to client business.
   1. In such a scenario make the site live in the 1st half and keep the WP site password protected and make sure it doesn't get indexed.
1. Make sure there are no open ended issues which the client has not signed off.
   1. If any known issues are there which we mutually agree to keep unresolved, get this in writing.
1. If we are working with vendors/partners/offshore resources, be mindful of timings that works for everyone and plan for required post go live support.
1. Check the domain health and traffic of pages if they are normal and continue to improve/is above the previous scores.
