# Axioned's Project Management Framework 

## 1. What is Project Management Framework :

A project management framework is a set of standard project management processes, templates and tools that should be used to initiate, plan, execute, control and close any project. A project is defined as an activity or series of activities with a defined beginning and end (it does not change if it is a client project or internal, billable or non-billable).

## 2. Key differences to consider between Project Management Framework and Project Methodology:

This can be a common source of confusion. But it's simple to untangle. A project methodology acts as a set of processes or principles that best help manage a project. Methodologies are usually pretty strictly defined and reinforced—they're formal for a reason. Without a strict code in place for your methodology, the project can fall apart.

Meanwhile, you have more freedom and flexibility within a framework. Change rules, adapt new rules mid-framework and abandon rules as needed. Plus, a framework includes so much more detail—even phases that might not be included in a methodology such as complex onboarding processes and post-go-live assessments.

There are many types of Project Methodology, but mostly use below:

1, Agile

2, Scrum

3, Kanban

4, Waterfall

Above is listed in the order they're being followed. Learn more about "Project Methodology" from [here](https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/project-management-methodology).

## 3. The Key Elements of a Project Management Framework

To successfully govern the Project Management Framework, one needs to focus on the project lifecycle, project control cycle and tools and templates. To understand more about the same, see below:

### A. Templates

There's really no need to reinvent the wheel with all the templates already available "[\_INDEX\_[INTERNAL] PRDXN Project Management : Templates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VGKmL3oDPyvjQBrxce724u_ckEJiCz4CzDpqhqSnfw8/edit#gid=0)" which one can follow on their project.

If you have a better option, it is very important that you discuss/share during the "PM Lean Coffee" so any new ideas can be implemented/added within existing processes/templates to help others and grow us as a team.

### C. Project Lifecycle

The project lifecycle is essentially how you'll set up your project management framework overall. You'll start mapping out your project management framework by taking a look at your project lifecycle.

There are typically five phases that make up the project lifecycle. They are initiation, planning, execution, management, review.

- **Pre Project:** During the stage, project goals/objectives are understood based on which efforts, resources utilisation, and a high-level creative brief that captures all the details as aboves are captured and costing is derived.

- **Define and Prepare**
  - **Initiation:** Initiation consists of research, planning, coordinating with both stakeholders, brainstorming ideas and interviewing customers/stakeholders/partners/manufacturers for input.
  - **Planning:** Now that you've identified all the key components you'll need to successfully make the project happen, you can start putting all the pieces of the puzzle together. Always remember to
    - What would be the development approach?
    - What are the tech/stack considerations and the rationale behind?
    - Is there need for any POC to be created in this phase to re-confirm the feasibility of any complex feature?
    - Is the scope aligned to the original scope in SOW
    - Does the build phase effort/timeline align to the original estimate as per SOW?
    - Where does each milestone go?
    - How many teams will be involved?
    - What are the risks for each team, and who will manage them?  
    All these questions and more will be answered and signed off on by the stakeholder team during this phase.

- **Build/Execution**
  - **Execution:** Now that all creative briefs have been dispersed to relevant team members, the project will move into the production phase for designers, developers, writers and other members to create the actual deliverable.
  - **Management:** The management phase is where you'll monitor, review and report all updates—particularly at each milestone—to key stakeholders. Additionally, you'll want to make a note of everything, anomaly or not, just in case, and keep all notes in a repository to refer back to at a later date.
  - **Review:** The project is complete, and the deliverable has been successfully, well, delivered. At this stage, you'll review all notes, key successes and points that could be improved upon with stakeholders, team members, customers and manufacturers.
