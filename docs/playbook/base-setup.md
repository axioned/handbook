## Essentials

### Slack

You'd typically the following channels for your project:

- **#live-clientabv-projectabv**: Public channel containing all Axioned team members assigned on the project.
- **#live-clientabv-projectabv-notifications**: Public channel with the same Axioned members with Jira, Trello, Sentry, etc integration.
- **#live-clientname-projectabv-client**: Shared channel with the client (if they are on Slack/use it as their prefered IM tool).

## Email alias

- You would have an email alias that distributes all emails that's received on it to all the members.
- If you need to get someone added - please reach out to itadmin@axioned.com (or message on #it-support)

## Folder structure

### Document access management

- Place them in the project folder
- Permissions to folder is best assigned to the email alias for the project
  - This way, all new members added to the alias automatically inherit the access to the docuements vs. having to manually add them in both the places
