It is a completely different new version of Google Analytics, it works on event-driven based models, and comes with a different set of reports. Reporting Interface There are different sets of reports in your GA4 view, and a limited number of reports are generated. As many of the reports are generated only when we start tracking events.The reporting interface of the GA4 view looks similar to that of Google Analytics for Firebase (because GA4 is built on Firebase analytics). Measurement model GA3 (aka Universal Analytics) uses the measurement model based on sessions and pageviews. Whereas, GA4 uses the measurement model based on events and parameters. GA3 uses a session-based model to track data. GA4 uses an event-based model to track data. Tracking IDs GA4 use the measurement ID.GA4 use the tracking ID. For More details please refer this doc Benefits of GA4 over GA3(aka Universal Analytics Google Analytics 4 (GA4) (also referred to as ‘apps + web’) is the latest version of Google Analytics. GA4 is much more advanced and follows an event-based architecture. Unlike Universal Analytics where we have page views and events, GA4 tracks everything as an event. For example, page views, session start, transactions, etc. are sent as events in GA4. So everything we track in GA4 is an event. GA4 provides a platform for both website and mobile app One of the biggest benefits of GA4 is that we can use it for your website and app, as well as both website and mobile app together.Under one property we can have multiple data streams like Android, iOS and web. GA4 user interface is much more user-centric In Universal Analytics, we have user buckets such as audience, acquisition, behavior, and conversion.Whereas in GA4 we have user buckets like acquisition, engagement, monetization, and retention. These buckets are more aligned with user-oriented reports and marketer’s goals. For More details please refer this doc GA4 Setup Step 1: Create a Google Analytics Account and setup property.Step 2: Upgrade UA to GA4 Default events that are tracked in GA4 There are three types of event parameters in Google Analytics 4 Automatically Collected ParametersCustom ParametersUser Properties Automatically Collected Parameters. Some parameters are automatically collected by GA4. Such parameters are called automatically-collected parameters. For example, by default, GA4 records the following parameters with every event: languagepage_locationpage_referrerpage_titlescreen_resolution How to see automatically-collected parameters in GA4 reports? Follow the steps below: Step-1: Navigate to your GA4 reporting view. Step-2: Click on ‘Events’ (under ‘Engagement’). Step-3: Scroll down and then click on an event name. Let’s click on the ‘page_view’ event. we should now see the detailed report about the ‘page_view’ event. Step-4: Click on the ‘PARAMETER NAME’ drop-down menu on the right-hand side. Step-5: Scroll down the drop-down list and then we should be able to see all the automatically collected parameters. How to track events based on default parameters and custom parameters for Custom events - Custom Definitions Create new dimensions and metrics from event parameters We can set up custom dimensions and metrics that get their values from the event parameters that we collect for your property. We can create an Author dimension that gets its values from the author parameter and an Article_Length metric that gets its value from the number_of_pages parameter. Event and user scope: A custom dimension has either an event scope or user scope. Event scope: In the example above, we would create the Author dimension to have an event scope.User scope: Create user-scoped custom dimensions to identify static or slowly changing attributes of your users, such as &quot;spender=true&quot;, &quot;profession=engineer&quot;, or &quot;favorite_team=Real Madrid&quot;.A custom metric always has an event scope. Limits We can create up to. 50 custom dimensions and 50 custom metrics per property25 uniquely named user-scoped custom dimensions If we have reached your quota but need to create new custom dimensions and/or metrics, we can archive the ones we are no longer using.To see the total number of custom dimensions and metrics you've created, click Custom definitions under Configure (in the left navigation), then click Quota information (top right). Create a custom dimension: Click Custom definitions under Configure (in the left navigation), then click Create custom dimensions: Enter the Dimension name.Select a Scope from the drop-down menu (Event or User).Enter a Description for your custom dimension.Select an Event parameter (event scope) or User property (user scope) from the list or enter the name of a parameter/property you'll collect in the future.Click Save.we will see a value of &quot;not set&quot; for a custom dimension during the first 48 hours. Create a custom metric: Click Custom definitions under Configure (in the left navigation), click the Custom metrics tab, then click Create custom metrics: Enter Metric name.Enter a Description for your custom metric.Select an Event parameter from the list or enter the name of a parameter you'll collect in the future.Choose a Unit of measurement from the drop-down menu. When we select Currency as the unit of measure, we must also identify the custom metric as a cost and/or revenue metric. When we identify the custom metric as a cost and/or revenue metric, then we can restrict access to it when we configure user roles that restrict access to cost and/or revenue metrics.Click Save.It takes 24-48 hours for custom metrics to be populated with data. Edit a custom dimension or metric: Click Custom definitions under Configure (in the left navigation), click the Custom metrics tab, then click Create custom metrics: Click Custom definitions under Configure (in the left navigation)In the row for the dimension or metric, click More, then click Edit.Make the changes we want, then click Save. Archive a custom dimension or metric: Archiving a custom dimension or metric affects any audiences, explorations, or segments that are based on that dimension or metric. Click Custom definitions under Configure (in the left navigation)In the row for the dimension or metric, click , then Archive. we see a list of the other entities in Analytics (e.g., audiences, explorations) that use the custom definition.This change can't be undone and the corresponding data can't be restored. Audiences When we archive a custom dimension or metric that is used in the definition of an audience, that audience definition becomes invalid and the audience doesn't accumulate any snew users.Historical data for the audience is preserved, but no new data is generated once the audience becomes invalid.we cannot export invalid audiences to other products (e.g., Google Ads, Optimize).If you've previously exported the audience to other products, the audience will continue to function as expected. However, since the audience is not accumulating new users, the user count will drop as the membership duration expires for existing users until the audience contains no users.

Then we have given a name to the current job as “Rsync to WP Engine Dev Env” This will be visible while the build is running env: then we have set some environment variables which we will be using further for server connection and the deployment dest: here we used the destination variable for storing the server details this can be found on the hosting dashboard like WPEngine/AWS etc.Syntax -&gt; username@remote_host(IP/Domain_name)while adding destination make sure you add the correct path for the deployment (where needs to be copied/deployed the entire repo as mentioned in the script)In our example, the site was installed at /sites/dev123v/ the entire wp setup and their files run: then we will proceed with the actual command that needs to be executed by action runner on the latest ubuntu as we declared in the above code Here we are executing multiple commands in series in order to deploy files from the GitHub repository to the development server echo: using this line we are saving/creating a private key file which will be required to establish a connection between the GitHub ubuntu machine and the development server further In our example, DEV_DEPLOY_KEY_PRIVATE this variable was used in the scriptThis needs to be created on GitHub under Settings -&gt; Secrets -&gt; Action (If not visible please contact the IT team/Sagar for access)The private key you can download it from the server using your hosting login chmod: setting up the proper permissions to the filersync: using this command we are transferring the files from the GitHub repository to the actual development server over an ssh connection For more information about rsync, ssh commands and there usage you can check these Official linksrsync ssh As you noticed in the above code we have excluded a few of the directories and files similarly you can add if any file/folder needs to be excluded in a deployment like a config file etc. In the end, we are deleting the cache folder (this is optional only if the cache is stored on a server in that case we can execute this) **NOTE:** As we saw in the above script consists of a single trigger which is attached on push action on the staging branch similarly you can write for multiple branches separate code for the production server and separate for the staging server _(recommended in that case create separate files ex. **prod.yml** and **dev.yml** files)_ "},{"title":"aws-amplify","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/processes/delivery/Continous/Managed/aws-amplify","content":"aws-amplify TODO","keywords":""},{"title":"netlify","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/processes/delivery/Continous/Managed/netlify","content":"netlify TODO","keywords":""},{"title":"gh-pages","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/processes/delivery/Continous/Managed/gh-pages","content":"gh-pages TODO","keywords":""},{"title":"regression","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/processes/delivery/Phased/regression","content":"regression TODO","keywords":""},{"title":"go-live","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/processes/delivery/Phased/go-live","content":"go-live TODO","keywords":""},{"title":"self-qa","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/processes/delivery/Phased/self-qa","content":"self-qa TODO","keywords":""},{"title":"Sentry.io","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/processes/observability/sentry","content":"Sentry.io TODO","keywords":""},{"title":"Improving Core Web Vitals","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/processes/performance/improving-core-web-vitals","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Adding height and width​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Improving Core Web Vitals","url":"/docs/processes/performance/improving-core-web-vitals#adding-height-and-width","content":"To improve the CLS score we need to add height and width attributes to media elements like images, videos, etc. &lt;img width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;425&quot; src=&quot;img-url.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;  "},{"title":"Dynamic height and width in WordPress​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Improving Core Web Vitals","url":"/docs/processes/performance/improving-core-web-vitals#dynamic-height-and-width-in-wordpress","content":"If you want to dynamically add height and width attributes we can use the inbuilt WP method wp_get_attachment_image() &lt;?php $image = get_field('image'); $size = 'full'; // (thumbnail, medium, large, full or custom size) if( $image ) { echo wp_get_attachment_image( $image, $size ); } ?&gt;  Reference: https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_get_attachment_image/ "},{"title":"Element render blocking and Remove unused javascript​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Improving Core Web Vitals","url":"/docs/processes/performance/improving-core-web-vitals#element-render-blocking-and-remove-unused-javascript","content":"If we are using a specific js and CSS file/library which is only needed for specific pages.

Google has provided a number of tools over the years to measure and report on performance. Some developers are experts at using these tools, while others have found the abundance of both tools and metrics challenging to keep up with. Site owners should not have to be performance gurus in order to understand the quality of experience they are delivering to their users. The Web Vitals initiative aims to simplify the landscape, and help sites focus on the metrics that matter most, the Core Web Vitals. "},{"title":"Core Web Vitals​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Measuring Core Web Vitals","url":"/docs/processes/performance/measuring-core-web-vitals#core-web-vitals","content":"Core Web Vitals Core Web Vitals are the subset of Web Vitals that apply to all web pages, should be measured by all site owners, and will be surfaced across all Google tools. Each of the Core Web Vitals represents a distinct facet of the user experience, is measurable in the field, and reflects the real-world experience of a critical user-centric outcome. "},{"title":"The metrics​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Measuring Core Web Vitals","url":"/docs/processes/performance/measuring-core-web-vitals#the-metrics","content":"The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds): Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading.First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of 100 milliseconds or less.Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of 0.1. or less. For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. In other words, if at least 75 percent of page views to a site meet the &quot;good&quot; threshold, the site is classified as having &quot;good&quot; performance for that metric. Conversely, if at least 25 percent of page views meet the &quot;poor&quot; threshold, the site is classified as having &quot;poor&quot; performance. So, for example, a 75th percentile LCP of 2 seconds is classified as &quot;good&quot;, while a 75th percentile LCP of 5 seconds is classified as &quot;poor&quot;.

WP_CLI::add_command() is used for both internal and third-party command registration. The synopsis of a command defines which positional and associative arguments a command accepts. Let’s take a look at the synopsis for wp plugin install: wp plugin install &lt;plugin|zip|url&gt;... [--version=&lt;version&gt;] [--force] [--activate] [--activate-network]  In this example, &lt;plugin|zip|url&gt;... is the accepted positional argument. In fact, wp plugin install accepts the same positional argument (the slug, ZIP, or URL of a plugin to install) multiple times. [--version=&lt;version&gt;] is one of the accepted associative arguments. It’s used to denote the version of the plugin to install. Notice, too, the square brackets around the argument definition; square brackets mean the argument is optional. WP-CLI also has a series of global arguments which work with all commands. For instance, including --debug means your command execution will display all PHP errors, and add extra verbosity to the WP-CLI bootstrap process. Using similar approach we have created a script that installs wp, creates db, registers user, installs a plugin - activates and deactivates wp plugins via single command. Below is the script for your reference: function setup_command() { // Read the JSON file $json = file_get_contents('axioned.json'); $json_data = json_decode($json, true); $path = $json_data['path']; $ver = $json_data['version']; $dbname = $json_data['dbname']; $dbuser = $json_data['dbuser']; $dbpass = $json_data['dbpass']; $dbhost = $json_data['dbhost']; $site_url = $json_data['site_url']; $title = $json_data['title']; $admin_name = $json_data['admin_name']; $admin_password = $json_data['admin_password']; $admin_email = $json_data['admin_email']; $pluginListInstall = $json_data['pluginListInstall']; $pluginListUninstall = $json_data['pluginListUninstall']; $acf_key = $json_data['acf_key']; $axioned_theme = $json_data['axioned_theme']; WP_CLI::runcommand('core download --path=&quot;'.$path.'&quot; --version='.$ver); WP_CLI::runcommand('core config --dbname=&quot;'.$dbname.'&quot; --dbuser=&quot;'.$dbuser.'&quot; --dbpass=&quot;'.$dbpass.'&quot; --dbhost=&quot;'.$dbhost.'&quot; --dbprefix=wp_ --path=&quot;'.$path.'&quot;'); WP_CLI::runcommand('db create --path=&quot;'.$path.'&quot;'); WP_CLI::line(&quot;WordPress installation started...&quot;); WP_CLI::runcommand('core install --url=&quot;'.$site_url.'&quot; --title=&quot;'.$title.'&quot; --admin_name=&quot;'.$admin_name.'&quot; --admin_password=&quot;'.$admin_password.'&quot; --admin_email=&quot;'.$admin_email.'&quot; --path=&quot;'.$path.'&quot;'); WP_CLI::runcommand('core verify-checksums --version='.$ver.' --path=&quot;'.$path.'&quot;',['exit_error' =&gt; false]); WP_CLI::line(&quot;Plugin installation started...&quot;); install($pluginListInstall, $path, $acf_key); uninstall($pluginListUninstall, $path); WP_CLI::runcommand('plugin verify-checksums --all --path=&quot;'.$path.'&quot;', ['exit_error' =&gt; false]); WP_CLI::runcommand('theme install '.$axioned_theme.' --activate --path=&quot;'.$path.'&quot;'); WP_CLI::success('Setup Website successfully.'); } WP_CLI::add_command('setup', 'setup_command'); function install($pluginList, $path, $acf_key) { $plugCount = count($pluginList); $progress = \\WP_CLI\\Utils\\make_progress_bar('Creating Posts', $plugCount); $options = ['exit_error' =&gt; false]; foreach ($pluginList as $plug) { $name = $plug[&quot;name&quot;]; $status = ($plug[&quot;status&quot;] ? $plug[&quot;status&quot;] : &quot;&quot;); $ver = ($plug[&quot;version&quot;] ? $plug[&quot;version&quot;] : &quot;&quot;); if($name == &quot;acf-pro&quot;) { if (file_put_contents('acf-pro.zip', file_get_contents(&quot;https://connect.advancedcustomfields.com/index.php?t=$ver&amp;p=pro&amp;a=download&amp;k=$acf_key&quot;) ) ) { WP_CLI::line(&quot;ACF Pro downloaded successfully.&quot;); WP_CLI::runcommand(&quot;plugin install ./acf-pro.zip&quot;); unlink(&quot;acf-pro.zip&quot;); WP_CLI::runcommand(&quot;plugin activate advanced-custom-fields-pro&quot;); } else { WP_CLI::line(&quot;ACF Pro downloading failed.&quot;); } continue; } $cli = &quot;plugin install &quot;.$name.&quot; &quot;.($status? &quot; --activate &quot;:&quot; &quot;).($ver? &quot;--version=&quot;.$ver : &quot; &quot;).' --path=&quot;'.$path.'&quot; '; WP_CLI::runcommand($cli,$options); $progress-&gt;tick(); } $progress-&gt;finish(); WP_CLI::success($plugCount.'
