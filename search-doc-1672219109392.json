WP_CLI::add_command() is used for both internal and third-party command registration. The synopsis of a command defines which positional and associative arguments a command accepts. Let’s take a look at the synopsis for wp plugin install:  usage: wp plugin install &lt;plugin|zip|url&gt;... [--version=&lt;version&gt;] [--force] [--activate] [--activate-network]  In this example, &lt;plugin|zip|url&gt;... is the accepted positional argument. In fact, wp plugin install accepts the same positional argument (the slug, ZIP, or URL of a plugin to install) multiple times. [--version=&lt;version&gt;] is one of the accepted associative arguments. It’s used to denote the version of the plugin to install. Notice, too, the square brackets around the argument definition; square brackets mean the argument is optional. WP-CLI also has a series of global arguments which work with all commands. For instance, including --debug means your command execution will display all PHP errors, and add extra verbosity to the WP-CLI bootstrap process. Using similar approach we have created a script that installs wp, creates db, registers user, installs a plugin - activates and deactivates wp plugins via single command. Below is the script for your reference: function setup_command() { // Read the JSON file $json = file_get_contents('axioned.json'); $json_data = json_decode($json, true); $path = $json_data['path']; $ver = $json_data['version']; $dbname = $json_data['dbname']; $dbuser = $json_data['dbuser']; $dbpass = $json_data['dbpass']; $dbhost = $json_data['dbhost']; $site_url = $json_data['site_url']; $title = $json_data['title']; $admin_name = $json_data['admin_name']; $admin_password = $json_data['admin_password']; $admin_email = $json_data['admin_email']; $pluginListInstall = $json_data['pluginListInstall']; $pluginListUninstall = $json_data['pluginListUninstall']; $acf_key = $json_data['acf_key']; $axioned_theme = $json_data['axioned_theme']; WP_CLI::runcommand('core download --path=&quot;'.$path.'&quot; --version='.$ver); WP_CLI::runcommand('core config --dbname=&quot;'.$dbname.'&quot; --dbuser=&quot;'.$dbuser.'&quot; --dbpass=&quot;'.$dbpass.'&quot; --dbhost=&quot;'.$dbhost.'&quot; --dbprefix=wp_ --path=&quot;'.$path.'&quot;'); WP_CLI::runcommand('db create --path=&quot;'.$path.'&quot;'); WP_CLI::line(&quot;WordPress installation started...&quot;); WP_CLI::runcommand('core install --url=&quot;'.$site_url.'&quot; --title=&quot;'.$title.'&quot; --admin_name=&quot;'.$admin_name.'&quot; --admin_password=&quot;'.$admin_password.'&quot; --admin_email=&quot;'.$admin_email.'&quot; --path=&quot;'.$path.'&quot;'); WP_CLI::runcommand('core verify-checksums --version='.$ver.' --path=&quot;'.$path.'&quot;',['exit_error' =&gt; false]); WP_CLI::line(&quot;Plugin installation started...&quot;); install($pluginListInstall, $path, $acf_key); uninstall($pluginListUninstall, $path); WP_CLI::runcommand('plugin verify-checksums --all --path=&quot;'.$path.'&quot;', ['exit_error' =&gt; false]); WP_CLI::runcommand('theme install '.$axioned_theme.' --activate --path=&quot;'.$path.'&quot;'); WP_CLI::success('Setup Website successfully.'); } WP_CLI::add_command('setup', 'setup_command'); function install($pluginList, $path, $acf_key) { $plugCount = count($pluginList); $progress = \\WP_CLI\\Utils\\make_progress_bar('Creating Posts', $plugCount); $options = ['exit_error' =&gt; false]; foreach ($pluginList as $plug) { $name = $plug[&quot;name&quot;]; $status = ($plug[&quot;status&quot;] ? $plug[&quot;status&quot;] : &quot;&quot;); $ver = ($plug[&quot;version&quot;] ? $plug[&quot;version&quot;] : &quot;&quot;); if($name == &quot;acf-pro&quot;) { if (file_put_contents('acf-pro.zip', file_get_contents(&quot;https://connect.advancedcustomfields.com/index.php?t=$ver&amp;p=pro&amp;a=download&amp;k=$acf_key&quot;) ) ) { WP_CLI::line(&quot;ACF Pro downloaded successfully.&quot;); WP_CLI::runcommand(&quot;plugin install ./acf-pro.zip&quot;); unlink(&quot;acf-pro.zip&quot;); WP_CLI::runcommand(&quot;plugin activate advanced-custom-fields-pro&quot;); } else { WP_CLI::line(&quot;ACF Pro downloading failed.&quot;); } continue; } $cli = &quot;plugin install &quot;.$name.&quot; &quot;.($status? &quot; --activate &quot;:&quot; &quot;).($ver? &quot;--version=&quot;.$ver : &quot; &quot;).' --path=&quot;'.$path.'&quot; '; WP_CLI::runcommand($cli,$options); $progress-&gt;tick(); } $progress-&gt;finish(); WP_CLI::success($plugCount.'

For example, decision records are a way for teams to think smarter and communicate better; decision records are not valuable if they're just an after-the-fact forced paperwork requirement. Some teams much prefer the name &quot;decisions&quot; over the abbreviation &quot;ADRs&quot;. When some teams use the directory name &quot;decisions&quot;, then it's as if a light bulb turns on, and the team starts putting more information into the directory, such as vendor decisions, planning decisions, scheduling decisions, etc. All of these kinds of information can use the same template. We hypothesize that people learn faster with words (&quot;decisions&quot;) over abbreviations (&quot;ADRs&quot;), and people are more motivated to write work-in-progress docs when the word &quot;record&quot; is removed, and also some developers and some managers dislike the word &quot;architecture&quot;. In theory, immutability is ideal. In practice, mutability has worked better for our teams. We insert the new info the existing ADR, with a date stamp, and a note that the info arrived after the decision. This kind of approach leads to a &quot;living document&quot; that we all can update. Typical updates are when we get information thanks to new teammates, or new offerings, or real-world results of our usages, or after-the-fact third-party changes such as vendor capabilties, pricing plans, license agreements, etc.","keywords":""},{"title":"WordPress Coding Standards","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/processes/Coding standards/WPCS","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Overview​","type":1,"pageTitle":"WordPress Coding Standards","url":"docs/processes/Coding standards/WPCS#overview","content":"The purpose of the WordPress Coding Standards is to create a baseline for collaboration and review within various aspects of the WordPress open source project and community, from core code to themes to plugins.

You can either use an existing project code base, fork a project you like on GitHub, or start from scratch. **Step 2:** **Open GitHub Actions in your repository to start building your CI/CD workflow** To begin building your CI/CD pipeline, open the GitHub Actions tab in your repository’s top navigation bar. Under Github Action you will find list of templates from you can choose as per your project techstack. A CI/CD workflows include:​ **A development workflow**This workflow runs through a few different jobs whenever a pull request is opened, edited, synchronized, or reopened. These jobs include setting up Node, installing npm packages and dependencies, running npm test, and cycling through a number of lint jobs too (setup node, install npm@latest, install dependencies, lint code… you get the idea).  **A CodeQL Analysis workflow**This workflow runs a series of CodeQL security tests on our code after we merge it to the main branch to ensure there are no known vulnerabilities. Check out the [YAML](https://github.com/aaronwinston/open-sauced/blob/main/.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml) file for yourself. It’s super simple  **A release and builds workflow**This workflow runs tests and enforces lint after releasing code changes to Docker and building the application. It also deploys the final code to our production environment You can see which jobs and steps happen in the [workflow](https://github.com/aaronwinston/open-sauced/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml) for yourself. **A storybook deployment workflow**This workflow deploys any UI component changes to our production website through our frontend UI tech **Step 3:** **Make changes to your code to trigger your CI/CD pipeline** You can proceed with the changes and push the code to GitHub and you will see in action We will see an example step by step you can follow that and get a complete idea of CI/CD using GitHub action working Tip: Few Github actions resources, basics to CI/CD - reference link  "},{"title":"CI/CD Example and detailed process step by step​","type":1,"pageTitle":"GitHub Actions for WordPress","url":"docs/processes/delivery/Continous/github-action/GithubActions#cicd-example-and-detailed-process-step-by-step","content":""},{"title":"Step 1: Setup Project/Repository​","type":1,"pageTitle":"GitHub Actions for WordPress","url":"docs/processes/delivery/Continous/github-action/GithubActions#step-1-setup-projectrepository","content":"Set up your Project/Repository on Github in which you want to implement the CI/CD process  "},{"title":"Step 2: Setup GitHub workflow​","type":1,"pageTitle":"GitHub Actions for WordPress","url":"docs/processes/delivery/Continous/github-action/GithubActions#step-2-setup-github-workflow","content":"Here we have 2 ways to set up the GitHub workflow (recommended is 2nd one for good practice) 1.

Google has provided a number of tools over the years to measure and report on performance. Some developers are experts at using these tools, while others have found the abundance of both tools and metrics challenging to keep up with. Site owners should not have to be performance gurus in order to understand the quality of experience they are delivering to their users. The Web Vitals initiative aims to simplify the landscape, and help sites focus on the metrics that matter most, the Core Web Vitals.

Each of the Core Web Vitals represents a distinct facet of the user experience, is measurable in the field, and reflects the real-world experience of a critical user-centric outcome. "},{"title":"The metrics​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Measuring Core Web Vitals","url":"docs/processes/performance/measuring-core-web-vitals#the-metrics","content":"The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds): Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading.First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of 100 milliseconds or less.Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of 0.1. or less. For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. In other words, if at least 75 percent of page views to a site meet the &quot;good&quot; threshold, the site is classified as having &quot;good&quot; performance for that metric. Conversely, if at least 25 percent of page views meet the &quot;poor&quot; threshold, the site is classified as having &quot;poor&quot; performance. So, for example, a 75th percentile LCP of 2 seconds is classified as &quot;good&quot;, while a 75th percentile LCP of 5 seconds is classified as &quot;poor&quot;.
