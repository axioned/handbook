## Take charge of your own on-boarding process

No one else is as invested in your success as you are. Everyone else is busy with their existing job, so embrace that you’ll need to take the reins. This is an opportunity to show you are proactive and self-directed — something every team member here at Axioned appreciates.

- What information do you need to start contributing?
- What platforms, folders, and logins do you need access to?
- Which specific people do you need to keep in the loop about your decisions?
- What kind of decisions does your buddy or manager want to be involved with? What do they want you to decide on your own?
- What questions do you have?
- What hunches do you want to validate?

## Review information with an active stance

Your new team might send you a ton of documents, resources, and links. As you review the docs, take an active stance. The great thing about high-performing environments is regardless of who you are, the team expects you to drive projects forward with accountability.

There’s no time to just set up meetings with cross-functional team members for the sake of it. If you do these meetings, you should go in thinking about how to make the best use of everyone’s time.

Come prepared with specific questions and an idea of what you want to get out of the meeting.

## Gather what you need to make recommendations and suggest next steps

So as you review, don’t just review for background info. Instead, assume you’ll be taking over those responsibilities.

Think about what you want to do. Consider the following:

- What resources you’ll need
- What you want to start/stop/continue
- How you want to lead in the next phase
- The sequence of what you want to do
- What you want to prioritize given finite resources/bandwidth

## Make note of areas of opportunity

Write down what you agree with and disagree with, or anything that provokes a strong reaction.

A recap that describes what happened in the past isn’t useful. A recap with your analysis and forward-looking recommendations is much better.

Form a point of view about what’s happening. This fresh perspective is one of the most valuable things you bring. It’s a big reason you were brought on in the first place.

**Don’t shy away from sharing what you’re noticing. You can always do a gut check and ask for context to validate your hypotheses.**
