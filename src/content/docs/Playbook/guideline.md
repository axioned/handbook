### Guidelines for Nominating MVPs for Town Hall Recognition

1. Nominators must explain observed behavior traits related to core values, not just list the values.
2. Avoid duplicate nominations within the past 2 months.
3. Aim for a maximum of 4 MVP awards per month; re-evaluate criteria if exceeded.
4. Limit each project to 2 nominations.
5. When any MVP nomination is published or announced the below approach and content is preferred. This also means the nominator(s) need to provide a compelling story - for other Axioned team members to see - that gives further explanation re: why this person is being awarded. This also helps the person being awarded understand exactly what they did that drove their award.

**_Preferable Format example:_**

Core Value MVP Award for "Ownership"

Ownership is defined as: We never pass the buck (read further here - <https://handbook.axioned.com/playbook/core-values/#ownership>)

For the past several months there have been many instances whereby xyz \[person's name\] has displayed ownership across their projects. They most recent scenario was when y scenario happened and \[person's name\] did abc. But this is just one example of many.
