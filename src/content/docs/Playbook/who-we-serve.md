Our team at Axioned specializes in digital engineering; helping businesses build, optimize, and scale digital user experiences. Whether it’s a website or application (app) - we bring ideas to life and help existing businesses grow. We typically work with/partner with the following ICPs (Ideal Client Profiles)...

## ICP #1 - High-Growth Consumer Services Businesses Dependent on Web Lead Gen for Growth
- Businesses that rely on - and invest in - their website as a critical lead generation and conversion engine.
- Often already investing in sales and marketing tactics (ads, SEO, etc.) to drive users to their site and are therefore invested in ensuring such users convert.
-	Axioned steps in as a trusted & skilled technology partner to keep their website(s) and marketing/integrated tech (e.g., CRM) fast, functional, and conversion-optimized.
- The relationship (Axioned x Client) is typically structured as ongoing monthly support for website maintenance, performance optimization, and iterative enhancements. As needs evolve, Axioned often leads efforts like site redesigns, CRM/tool integrations, data workflows, site analytics, and/or SEO improvements.

**Client pain points (the problem we're solving):**
- 1/ Website is underperforming and losing leads due to low conversions, poor UX, slow speed, weak CRM/data workflows, or SEO issues.
- 2/ Existing tech partner or team can’t match the required pace or delivery velocity.

***Note:*** *We’re often referred to such clients by agency partners—creative, branding, and ad shops—who trust us as a tech partner to deliver on "all things tech." We welcome and encourage these partnerships. Interested in joining our agency partner program? [Contact Libby](https://www.linkedin.com/in/libby-swan-axioned-enabling-digital-endeavours/).*

## ICP #2 - Innovators: Stand-alone or In-house
- Product teams that are starting or scaling, and need a trusted partner to either:
- a) bring their POC/MVP to life (often leveraging AI tools like Cursor, GitHub Co-Pilot, Replit), or
- b) scale an existing digital product or platform.

**Client pain points (the problem we're solving):**
- 1/ Moving too slowly to validate and iterate—losing time, feedback, and momentum.
- 2/ Restricted in-house tech expertise to execute at the desired pace/velocity.

## How do we work with our Clients?
- We prefer to work on a monthly retainer model providing continuous/dedicated support to drive continuous improvement.
- We also work on project (SOW - Scope of Work) basis.
