Our goal on every client call is simple: make progress. That means showing up prepared, staying aligned to priorities, and managing time well. This page outlines a shared approach to running calls — before, during, and after — to keep them focused, outcome-driven, and respectful of everyone’s time.

Client calls are where decisions are made, momentum is built, and alignment is reinforced. Time spent on calls should be intentional and geared toward moving things forward.

## Before the Call: Prep and Agenda

To make the most of each session:

- **Clarify the agenda ahead of time.** This might be noted in a calendar invite, Basecamp thread, or Slack message.
- **Surface any additional discussion topics early.** This helps ensure there’s space to address them or flag what might need to be handled async.
- **Review key context.** Relevant notes, links, blockers, or deliverables should be revisited ahead of time so the conversation can start productively.

## During the Call: Staying on Track

The purpose of each call is to clarify direction, resolve blockers, and align on next steps. Staying on track helps ensure the conversation leads to progress.

- Stay anchored to agreed priorities
- Flag blockers or pending decisions early
- Confirm action items before the call ends

## Managing Scope and Staying Aligned

It’s common for conversations to expand beyond the original scope — especially in fast-paced or multi-threaded work. While valuable ideas often emerge this way, it’s important to stay aligned with the primary goals of the call.

- **If a team member brings up something off-track**, it’s okay to call it out — even informally, e.g., “Tangent alert” — and bring focus back.
- **If a topic shift comes from another participant**, it can be acknowledged and parked for follow-up:

  > “Let’s come back to [topic]. For now, we want to make sure we get through [priority].”

These nudges help maintain momentum without shutting down important contributions.

## Providing Context for a Redirect

When a conversation is being steered back to the core agenda, a quick explanation can help reinforce intent:

> “The goal is to ensure forward progress on [stated focus]. Staying aligned here helps everyone involved.”

## After the Call: Follow-Up

After most calls, a quick summary of outcomes — decisions made, next steps, and owners — is shared via Basecamp, email, or Slack. These help track progress and reduce ambiguity.

## A Shared Commitment

Whether internal or external, productive calls require preparation, structure, and shared focus. Everyone’s time is valuable — and keeping calls intentional ensures it’s used well.
