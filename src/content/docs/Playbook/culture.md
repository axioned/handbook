## Shared adventure

- Everyone can and is expected to make an impact beyond their individual assignments.
- Each one of you can help shape us the direction we take as a company.
- One of our core values is, [Help First](https://handbook.axioned.com/playbook/core-values/#help-first), and we are driven by mutual success.
- Opportunities to contribute are boundless but may not be clearly defined.
- We don't believe in micromanaging someone's growth. If you want towards something specific, speak up and we do our best (and work with you) to find a way.

## Iteration at heart

- For most things in life, there is no such thing as "done".
- Think of everything we do through the lense of "minimum viable change".
- Always strive to work iteratively, quickly, putting it front of others - all before it is done.
- Changes or interations are best anchored to shorter timescale (few hours instead of days, days instead of weeks).
- Put things in front of your team, your customers, and work with them to iterate and improve.
- Everything is iterable - from code, documentation, processes, or even meetings. Don't do things just because someone told you to do it that way.

## Fostering Workplace Respect

- At Axioned, maintaining a respectful and professional environment is non-negotiable.
- Teasing, even if meant in good humor, can easily cross the line into bullying.
- Before making a comment - that's directed at an individual or group of people - ask yourself:
  - If you're not 150% sure that the person(s) your comment is about is also going to find it funny, do not say it.
  - Would you feel 150% comfortable in asking the person directly - one on one - in advance - “are you okay if I tease you about xxx?” If you can’t see yourself doing this, don’t do it.
  - Laughing and jokes in the office are fine - but never be at the expense of another person/group of people.
- Let our actions continue to showcase that we are all responsible and respectful adults. We can all continuously improve in this area.
