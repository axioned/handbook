## Shared adventure

- Everyone can and is expected to make an impact beyond their individual assignments.
- Each one of you can help shape us the direction we take as a company.
- One of our core values is, [Help First](https://handbook.axioned.com/playbook/core-values/#help-first), and we are driven by mutual success.
- Opportunities to contribute are boundless but may not be clearly defined.
- We don't believe in micromanaging someone's growth. If you want towards something specific, speak up and we do our best (and work with you) to find a way.

## Iteration at heart

- For most things in life, there is no such thing as "done".
- Think of everything we do through the lense of "minimum viable change".
- Always strive to work iteratively, quickly, putting it front of others - all before it is done.
- Changes or interations are best anchored to shorter timescale (few hours instead of days, days instead of weeks).
- Put things in front of your team, your customers, and work with them to iterate and improve.
- Everything is iterable - from code, documentation, processes, or even meetings. Don't do things just because someone told you to do it that way.
