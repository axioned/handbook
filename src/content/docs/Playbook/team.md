Much of the work we do at Axioned is done in teams. Working in a team can be challenging, but it can also be rewarding. Here are some tips to help you work effectively in a team:

- **Clear Communication**
  - Be clear and communicate with intent. ([ECG](https://handbook.axioned.com/playbook/communication/))
  - Pay attention, show understanding, and provide feedback.
  - Respect the time and attention of others (eg: structure, organisation or length of meetings).
  - Understand that people have different communication preferences.
- **Respect and Inclusivity**
  - Value everyone's input, opinions, and perspectives - irrespective of consensus.
  - Embrace disagreements, and see them as discussions, not debates.
    - If stuck, agree to disagree; focus on actions and outcomes over words.
- **Shared vision and goals (your north star)**
  - Prioritize team goals over individual achievements in a team setting.
  - Offer help and ask for help when needed. ([Help First](https://handbook.axioned.com/playbook/core-values/#help-first))
  - If you are not sure about the goals (eg: project/product north star), ask for clarification.
- **Continuous Improvement**
  - Acknowledge and appreciate the intent and the efforts that people put in.
  - Provide constructive feedback that is helpful, and focused on improvement.
  - Actively practice and encourage (not just "ask for") continuous learning and development (like training opportunities, etc).
  - Periodically reflect together on team performance and areas for improvement.
- **Connect with each other**
  - Finding opportunities to know your team members beyond the work they do.
  - Find shared interests and activities that can help build relationships.

:::tip
Continous learning and growth is a shared responsibility. We need to carve out time for ourselves and for those around us. Yes, as with everything else, it's a balance.
