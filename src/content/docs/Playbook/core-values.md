When we use the expression Axioned's **Core Values** we mean: the behaviours, attitudes and standards we would like each and everyone of us to:

- value in our colleagues
- use as our "guiding light" for how we should go about our day
- compare ourselves against, at all times, no matter how long we’ve been with us or what your role is

The dictionary definition of values that we’re referring to here is:

> "principles or standards of behaviour; one's judgement of what is important in life."

Synonyms:

> principles, moral principles, ethics, moral code, morals, moral values, standards, moral standards, code of behaviour, rules of conduct, standards of behaviour.

## Our Core Values

We wanted to get to the heart of what we believe in, and what we want to be known for. Over the years, we have tried to refine these - and in this iteration, we have been able to distill them down with greater degree of specificity (which you might also see by the number words used to describe each value 😅).

### Action Oriented 🚀

Decisions are temporary (and reversible). Don't wait for perfection. Just act. And then iterate.

### Intensely Curious 🧠

No one knows everything. Be open to learning, being wrong, being challenged, being inspired, being vulnerable. Curiosity is your superpower.

### Help First 🤝

We are not in a "I win, you lose" environment; bring people along for the journey. The best way to help someone is to teach them how to help themselves and others.

### Proactive Ownership 🏅

Ownership is a mindset. It's a way of thinking and acting as if you were the owner. It's a way of being accountable for your actions and the outcomes.

### Open Collaboration 🤜🤛

We are all work-in-progress, so is everything we do. Be comfortable with "working in the open" - whether it is sharing your views candidly or inviting feedback from others.

:::note[Update]
As of September 2023, we have refined our core values to 5, with the intention of making them more actionable and specific. This has been inspired by [our [Guiding Principles](/docs/Playbook/guiding-principles).](https://handbook.axioned.com/playbook/guiding-principles/)
