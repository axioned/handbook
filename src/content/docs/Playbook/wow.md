You might hear us talking a lot about WOW'ing our clients (and teammates). It's not just about delivering what was asked for, but also about delivering more than what was expected. It's about going the extra mile to make sure that our clients are happy and satisfied with our work. It's about creating a lasting impression that will make them want to work with us again and again.

## Why?

- Every client is different, so we need to understand what “WOW” means to them.
- It helps us grow; both as a company and as individuals.
- It helps us build long-lasting relationships with them.
- We “secure” business (and future revenues), which we can re-invest in our team, the company and our clients.
- It is built upon through consistency (and not a one-off or a periodic activitiy).

:::danger
It is important to be mindful of the trade-off or opportunity cost (eg: doing something new at the cost of other critical things “falling down” - either for the same client or another)
:::

:::caution
There is a also balance between “WOW’ing” and “over-promising” (or "burning out).
