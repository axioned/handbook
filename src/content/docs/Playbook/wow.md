You might hear us talking a lot about WOW'ing our clients (and teammates). It's not just about delivering what was asked for, but also about delivering more than what was expected. It's about going the extra mile to make sure that our clients are happy and satisfied with our work. It's about creating a lasting impression that will make them want to work with us again and again.

## Why?

- Every client is different, so we need to understand what “WOW” means to them.
- It helps us grow; both as a company and as individuals.
- It helps us build long-lasting relationships with them.
- We “secure” business (and future revenues), which we can re-invest in our team, the company and our clients.
- It is built upon through consistency (and not a one-off or a periodic activitiy).

:::danger
It is important to be mindful of the trade-off or opportunity cost (eg: doing something new at the cost of other critical things “falling down” - either for the same client or another)
:::

:::caution
There is a also balance between “WOW’ing” and “over-promising” (or "burning out).

## How?

To truly WOW customers, it's essential to meet and exceed their expectations. Here's how:

- **Human-friendly** - Whether it is your client or a colleague, all of them have the same basic needs in terms of how they interact - with human-levels of empathy. Sometimes, just getting on a call and talking things through (especially for complex interactions) goes a long way.
- **Timeliness** - Whether it is the timely deliverables or even regular updates go a long way in building trust and confidence.

:::tip
Tip: Proactive updates for work-in-progress or even for delays are appreciated.
:::

- **Clear information** - We communicate our expectations/wants/needs of our clients clearly and concisely. This also means we need to have a deeper understanding of what our clients want/need (and not just what they say).
- **Simplify things** - Always seek opportunities to simplify how we communicate by **being more intentional**.  Ensure customers understand what to expect, avoid jargons, and regularly refine communications for simplicity.
