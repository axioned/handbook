**By default - if you are formally assigned on a project - all work is work.**

Some engagements do require us to manage and account for the time spent on a project. And yes, there are times when the time spent on a project is higher than the time that was assigned/allocated to you.

Determination of whether something is billable and non-billable should **not** be a direct result of who is doing the work, or how much time was allocated to you.

The key determining factor is - the value the work creates, and is that delivered at a “fair” ROI (return on investment).

We understand that the word “fair” might introduce a degree of subjectivity. We have added a few guidelines on how to determine where an activity falls.

**Remember, these are guidelines and not rules; common sense above everything.**

If in doubt, ask your Project Manager or fellow members in your project channel, or [#help](https://axioned.slack.com/archives/C016UBG8QGG).

## Billable

- All meetings (including but not limited to kick-offs, backlog refinement, planning), check-ins and standups with the Clients
- Any activities necessary for executing on a piece of work such as brainstorming discussions, design reviews, and so on
- Research needed to do the work (it is our duty to involve the right people at the right time)
- Working on audits (security, maintenance, performance, etc), associated fixes, working on tech debt, and similar items - unless covered in warranty

## Non-billable

- Knowledge transfer and training sessions as a result of changes initiated by Axioned
- Internal discussions to seek support/resolve queries (note: some of these might also be billable hours if they're essential to delivering on the value)
- Generally speaking, 5-10% (in a month) variance is something AOK/expected. The Project Manager would know and decide.
- Specific initiatives or opportunities that are reviewed and approved by Axioned Management (and/or Accounts)

:::tip
Anything actual (or forecasted) overages of 10% or more (of a month’s budget) should be spiked and approved by Anurag or Accounts.
