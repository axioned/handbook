# Client Call Guidelines

Our goal at Axioned is to ensure we achieve our clients' goals efficiently and effectively. We operate on the principle that **if everything is a priority, then nothing truly is**. This guides our approach to every interaction and project, especially during client calls.

## 1. Prioritizing for Success: Our Commitment to Focus

* **Our Core Objective:** As your service provider, our primary aim is to get you to where you need to go, ensuring your goals are met efficiently and effectively.
* **The Principle of Priority:** We believe that if everything is deemed a priority, then nothing truly is. This core principle guides all our interactions and project approaches.

## 2. Guiding the Conversation: Staying on Track

* **Maintaining Focus:** Our role is to help keep discussions focused on what truly matters for your project.
* **Gentle Redirection:** If a client doesn't naturally prioritize a discussion point, we will gently guide them back to the key objectives.
* **Polite Firmness (When Time is Tight):** Especially on calls with limited time, we may politely but firmly redirect the conversation to ensure we are maximizing our shared time and progress.

We are all mindful of not encouraging tangents, whether they originate from our team or from the client. Tangents are **distractions** that can derail progress. Everyone, particularly our team, must actively work to avoid indulging in this habit.

## 3. Managing Tangents Effectively

Tangents can occur, and how we handle them is crucial for maintaining focus:

* **When We Initiate a Tangent:**
    * If one of us inadvertently starts a tangent, we will use a clear internal signal, such as "**Tangent alert!**"
    * Other team members are encouraged to help bring the conversation back on track.
* **When the Client Initiates a Tangent:**
    * We will politely redirect by using language such as: "Let's come back to **[main topic/priority X]**. We can definitely explore **[tangent topic]** after this call, perhaps asynchronously."
    * Our aim is to acknowledge their point while maintaining focus. This approach should always be used mindfully and never to weaponize the concept of tangents.

## 4. Communicating Our Focus

Should we need to provide context for our focused approach, we will remind clients of our core objective:

* **Our Job as Your Service Provider:** "It's our job as your service provider to get you to where you need to go."
* **Maintaining Focus on Priorities:** "Given the current priorities, we want to keep our conversation precisely focused on **[restate the agreed-upon priorities]**."

This reinforces our commitment to their success and ensures alignment on the agenda.
