### Nominating for MVP Awards

- Nominators must explain observed behavior traits related to core values, not just list the values.
- Avoid duplicate nominations within the past 2 months.
- Aim for a maximum of 4 MVP awards per month; re-evaluate criteria if exceeded.
- Limit each project to 2 nominations.
- When any MVP nomination is published or announced the below approach and content is preferred. This also means the nominator(s) need to provide a compelling story - for other Axioned team members to see - that gives further explanation re: why this person is being awarded. This also helps the person being awarded understand exactly what they did that drove their award.

#### Sample nomination format

> **Core Value MVP Award for Ownership**
>
> For the past several months there have been many instances whereby \[name\] has displayed ownership across \[area or domain or project(s)\]. They most recent scenario was when y scenario happened and \[name\] did \[specific behaviours and actions\]. But this is just one example of many.
