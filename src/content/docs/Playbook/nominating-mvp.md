### Nominating for MVP Awards

- Nominators must explain observed behavior traits related to core values, not just list the values.
- Aim for a maximum of 2 MVP awards per month.
- It is okay to not have a nominiation in a particular month (don't force it).
- When any MVP nomination is published or announced the below approach and content is preferred.
  - This also means the nominator(s) need to provide a compelling story - for other Axioned team members to see - that gives further explanation re: why this person is being awarded.
  - This also helps the person being awarded understand exactly what they did that drove their award.

#### Sample nomination format

> **Core Value MVP Award for Ownership**
>
> For the past several months there have been many instances whereby \[name\] has displayed ownership across \[area or domain or project(s)\]. They most recent scenario was when y scenario happened and \[name\] did \[specific behaviours and actions\]. But this is just one example of many.
