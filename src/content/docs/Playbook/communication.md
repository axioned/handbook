1. Communicate your assumptions - verbally or in writing.
2. Use direct communication and involve everyone concerned.
3. When in doubt, make and communicate recommendations and decisions. (Don't wait for someone else to)
4. Processes are there for a reason: If something is not working as per the agreed to process, ASAP communication is a must
5. Communication, in almost all cases, needs to come before a "solution".
6. Understand the perspective of the end-user: If in doubt or unsure, communicate and ask questions.
