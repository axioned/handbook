1. Communicate your assumptions - verbally or in writing.
2. Use direct communication and involve everyone concerned.
3. When in doubt, make and communicate recommendations and decisions. (Don't wait for someone else to)
4. Processes are there for a reason: If something is not working as per the agreed to process, ASAP communication is a must
5. Communication, in almost all cases, needs to come before a "solution".
6. Understand the perspective of the end-user: If in doubt or unsure, communicate and ask questions.

**Prioritizing for Success: Our Commitment to Focus**
At Axioned, our core objective as your service provider is to ensure we achieve your goals efficiently and effectively. We understand that if everything is a priority, then nothing truly is. This principle guides our approach to every interaction and project.

**Guiding the Conversation: Staying on Track**
Our role is to help you stay focused on what truly matters. If a client doesn't naturally prioritize, we'll gently guide them there. When time is limited, especially on calls, we may politely but firmly redirect the conversation to ensure we're maximizing our time together.

We are all mindful of not encouraging tangents, whether from ourselves or our clients. Tangents are distractions that can derail progress. Everyone, especially our team, must actively work to avoid indulging in this habit.

**Managing Tangents Effectively**
- When we initiate a tangent: If one of us inadvertently starts a tangent, we'll use a clear internal signal like "Tangent alert!" Other team members are encouraged to help bring the conversation back on track.
- When the client initiates a tangent: We'll politely redirect by saying something like, "Let's come back to [main topic/priority X]. We can definitely explore [tangent topic] after this call, perhaps asynchronously." Our aim is to acknowledge their point while maintaining focus. We'll always use this approach mindfully and never weaponize the concept of tangents.

**Communicating Our Focus**
Should we need to provide context for our focus, we'll remind clients that "it's our job as your service provider to get you to where you need to go. Given the current priorities, we want to keep our conversation precisely focused on [restate the agreed-upon priorities]." This reinforces our commitment to their success and ensures alignment.
