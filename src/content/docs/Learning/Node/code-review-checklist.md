4 | Are errors handled centrally? Instead of middlewares |

14 | Always enable monitoring and logging for the node app in case where we want to debug the application on failure |
15 | Rate limiting the end points. |
16 | Try to make the code more functional. (Use of modular styling of code) |
17 | DB connections & file operation like streaming should be properly closed. |
18 | If using multiple DB queries/calls within a block of code which are independent of each other then they can be wrapped in Promise.all |
19 | Proper commenting should be followed for each and every API |

25 | Use explain stage while writing big queries to see how well the query is performing |
26 | Use of $match, $limit & $skip can filter out most of the documents if used on a early pipeline stage. | For detailed aggregation pipeline optimization, you can refer [**here**](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline-optimization/).
