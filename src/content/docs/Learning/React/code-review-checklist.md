6 | Minimize logic in the render method. Logic should be in helper methods, container components or in Redux actions (if used)
7 | Use functional components for components that don’t use state
8 | Make sure you don’t edit props within a component

27 | Sync and npm-check to automate the task of identifying insecure and outdated components. 
28 | Use Redux for global state management
