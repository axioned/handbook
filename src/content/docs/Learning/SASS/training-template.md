# Overview

Sass (short for "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets") is a popular preprocessor scripting language that is used to generate CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Sass is a more powerful and efficient way to write CSS code, as it provides additional features and functionality that are not available in standard CSS.
