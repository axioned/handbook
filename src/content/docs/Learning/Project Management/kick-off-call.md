## Purpose

The goal of this document is to provide guidelines to the Project Managers/SPOC to be able to follow appropriate steps while having a kick-off call/meeting.

:::tip
Note: SPOC = Single Point of Contact (which may or may not be the Project Manager)
:::

## Prerequisite

- SOW should be signed by axioned and client.
- Internal SOW version is shared by the Accounts team.
- Approval from Accounts to proceed with kick-off.
- Check if the project is already created in Zoho (as this is done during the estimation process). If not, create a project in Zoho with adding the appropriate project code and budget hours. And mark the status as Active.
- Request resources for the project from the respective resource managers.

## Process Flow

### Pre Kickoff Call Prep/Actions

1. The SPOCs shall schedule an Engagement Kick-off call with internal team, Client, and their team.
2. Agenda for the meeting should be added on invite.
3. Read SOW/Agreement in detail and take notes.
4. Have an internal call with the project team to ensure everyone is aware of the project objective/goal, scope, and timelines.
5. Refer to email communication to have a background of the discussion till date.
6. Focus on the client’s background, the vision, and the approach you’ll take in the project.
7. Prepare questions which need to be asked on the kickoff call.

### Kickoff Call Discussion Points:

- Break the Ice/Spike conversations:
  - As mostly we engage in virtual/online kickoff meetings, make sure to join the meeting link on time.
  - While you wait for all members to join to start with the agenda, avoid awkward silence. Greet the members as and when they join and keep the conversation going.
  - Turn on your Video.
- Team Introduction:
  - PM/SPOC to introduce Project team members who would be contributing to this project.
  - Request intro from Client team members.
  - Understanding the Role & Responsibilities of project members from the Client side.
- Agreement/SOW Walkthrough:
  - Explaining the Purpose/objective/goal of the project.
  - Re-review (for the benefit of all contributing team members) the driving “Why?” behind the project/engagement in question.
  - Walk through the SOW’s/Engagement Agreement.
  - In Scope/Out of Scope Activities.
  - Device scope and Techstack.
  - Client’s Deliverables/Dependencies.
  - Estimated Project Timeline.
- Confirm which tool(s) shall be used throughout the engagement to manage the following (based on joint SPOC preferences):
  - Project Management tools for managing Project activities: GitHub, Trello, Jira, Basecamp, ?
  - Chat communications: Slack, Google Hangout, Microsoft teams?
  - Conference call tools: Zoom, Google Hangout, Google Meets.
  - Note- Ask the client's preference here and then make your recommendations.

- Confirm the timing, agenda, and preferences for ongoing check-in calls required throughout the engagement.
  - Depending on the Complexity/tenure of the project, we can decide the no. of check-in calls per week.
  - Deciding the participants.
- Clarify HTWwM Preferences (from both SPOCs):
  - Gather answers from the Client’s SPOC re: their “[How to work with me](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1LFCXKgN-BfBPHOqn2zBFkLITv784tNxitMwi_vdEnck/edit?usp=drive_web)” preferences.
  - Share the Axioned team’s answers in return.

### Post Kickoff Call:

- Send Call notes on email.
