In providing effective support to our clients, it is essential to have a structured approach for addressing technical questions. The following process ensures timely and accurate responses, maintains clear communication, and fosters strong client relationships.

This guideline outlines the steps to follow when responding to client inquiries about technical issues.

## Understand the Question

- Review the question carefully.
- Internally assess the nature and urgency without involving the client.

## Acknowledge the Client

- Confirm receipt of the question. As always, as soon as possible (no longer than a business day).
- Inform the client that you are reviewing it and will follow up shortly.

## Internal Alignment

- Hold a brief discussion with relevant team members to gather initial insights.
- If full alignment isnâ€™t possible right away, set appropriate expectations with the client.

## Confirm Approval Process

- Identify the reviewer who will approve the draft response (ideally one decision-maker with knowledge on particular technicality).

## Draft & Obtain Internal Sign-Off

- Prepare a clear, client-friendly response.
- Get approval from the designated reviewer.

## Respond to the Client

- Send the final response.
- If appropriate, suggest a 20-minute follow-up call, proposing a date and time.

## Anticipate/Handle Further Questions

- Consider potential follow-up questions and prepare for them.
- Repeat the above steps as needed, adjusting timelines and processes accordingly.
