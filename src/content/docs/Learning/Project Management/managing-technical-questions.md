When a client raises a technical question, how we handle it can shape their confidence in us. The goal isn't just to get the answer—it's to respond clearly, efficiently, and with context that builds trust.

This guide outlines a simple, structured process for handling technical questions. It's designed to reduce back-and-forth, minimize internal guesswork, and improve clarity—for both the client and our team.

## Clarify the Question

- Read it twice. Identify what's being asked and why.
- If anything is ambiguous or seems to be missing context, get clarity internally before replying externally.
- You don't need to be technical—but you do need to understand enough to steer it in the right direction.

## Acknowledge Promptly and Usefully

- Always confirm receipt within one business day—ideally sooner.
- Avoid canned phrases like "we'll get back to you." Make your acknowledgment useful:
- "We're reviewing this internally—looks related to [X], but confirming with the team."
- "Thanks—checking if this relates to the earlier [issue/feature]. Will confirm shortly."

## Tag and Triage Internally

- Loop in the right engineer or tech lead with relevant context.
- Be clear on urgency. Use flags or comments if it's blocking or part of a broader concern.
- If the issue cuts across teams (e.g. backend + frontend), help orient by pointing to previous tickets or decisions.

## Draft the Response First

- Try to draft a first version of the client response. Doesn't need to be perfect.
- This speeds things up and reduces load on the technical team.
- Writing it out helps clarify what's still unclear.

## Confirm Reviewer / Approver

- Use judgment on whether a review is needed. If the response is technical or carries delivery, scope, or cost implications—get it signed off.
- If you're simply relaying details that were already aligned internally (e.g. via Slack, Figma, tickets), you usually don't need another review.
- When in doubt, do a quick check-in with the tech lead or project lead before sending.

## Send the Final Response

- Keep it clear, direct, and free of jargon unless the client is technical.
- Where appropriate, offer a quick 15-20 minute call to walk through it.
- Flag if the issue may affect scope, timeline, or future work—don't wait for the client to bring it up.

## Anticipate Follow-Ups

- Think a step ahead: What might the client ask next? What else do they need to know?
- Where possible, pre-empt and include that context in your reply.
- If the question signals a broader risk or theme, flag it internally.

:::note

When you're not sure, ask yourself:

> Would this response build my confidence if I were the client?

If not, revisit it. Ask. Improve.
