We recognize that the whole idea of remote working is still quite new, and can only be successful with active participation from the whole team. Here's how you can participate:

- Propose or suggest any change to this site by creating a merge request.
- Create an issue if you have any questions or if you see an inconsistency.

If you need help with the above or want to soundboard with someone on your thought/idea/suggestion, head on over to [#handbook](https://axioned.slack.com/archives/C02UV6BREDU).
