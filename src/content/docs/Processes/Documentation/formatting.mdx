We have a shared template for all our documentation, reports, etc that we use across the company as well as our clients. Whenever you are creating a new document, please use the template as a reference.

## Template

Make a copy of the template and name it as per the document you are creating.

### Reference Document Style Guide

- **Axioned’s Logo:** Positioned prominently at the top-right within the header space, ideally with a width of 1.34 and a height of 0.5 inches.
- **Footer:** Include page numbers in the footer (e.g., "Page X of Y"), center-aligned.
- **Fonts:** Use a consistent font type throughout the document (e.g., IBM Plex Sans, Calibri, Proxima Nova).
- **Font Size:** Define hierarchy through font sizes (e.g., 11 for paragraphs, 15 for Heading 1, 13 for Heading 2, etc.).
- **Heading:** Use defined heading levels (H1, H2, H3, etc.) to create a clear document structure.
- **Line Spacing:** Maintain consistent line spacing—recommend 1.15 or 1.5 for readability.
- **Consistency in Color Usage:** Use a consistent color palette that aligns with branding guidelines.
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Use bold, italics, and underlining purposefully to guide attention—not decoratively.
- **Bullet and Numbered Lists:** Use bullet points for non-sequential items and numbered lists for sequential information. Ensure consistent indentation.
- **Table Formatting:** Use tables for data presentation with consistent column widths and row heights to enhance readability.
- **Images and Graphics:** Use high-quality images with captions where necessary. Position thoughtfully within the layout.
- **Hyperlink Formatting:** Use descriptive anchor text (e.g., "Visit our website" instead of "Click here").
- **Page Layout:** Maintain uniform margins and indentations throughout.
- **Table of Content Section:** Ensure TOC is well-formatted, linked, up-to-date, and clearly reflects document structure.

## Review Process

- **Proofreading:** Review all documents for typos, grammatical issues, and clarity before sharing.
- **Feedback Loop:** For critical or high-impact documents, get the document reviewed for verification and/or improvements:
  - Primary reviewer: QA (Pranit)
  - Secondary reviewer: PMO (Sumeet/Shyam)
