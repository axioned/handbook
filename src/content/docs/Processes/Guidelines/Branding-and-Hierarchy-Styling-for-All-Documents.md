## Objective
This document is to emphasize the importance of consistent branding and hierarchy styling in our internal and client-facing documentation. We have observed that informal or poorly organized documents can lead to frustration and diminished interest in reading. By adhering to a well-structured format, we aim to enhance clarity and visibility, ensuring that stakeholders remain engaged and can easily navigate the content.

By doing so, we can maintain a high standard of documentation that reflects our commitment to quality and professionalism.

## What’s “Good” vs. “Bad” Practice?
| **Formatting Element**              | **GOOD ✅**                                                                                                                                                    | **BAD ❌**                                                                                                                                              |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Axioned’s Logo**                 | Positioned prominently at the top-right within the header space, ideally with a width of 1.34 and a height of 0.5 inches. | Placed randomly in the document without regard for layout, such as at the bottom or in the margin.                                                    |
| **Footer**                         | Include page numbers in the footer (e.g., "Page X of Y") center-aligned.                                                                                       | Omitting page numbers or using unclear footers (e.g., only "Page 1" without context).                                                                 |
| **Fonts**                          | Use of a consistent font type throughout the document (e.g., IBM Plex Sans, Calibri, Proxima Nova).                                                            | Mixed fonts within a single document (e.g., Arial for a heading, Calibri for paragraphs, Inter for disclaimers).                                      |
| **Font Size**                      | Use of consistent font sizes based on hierarchy/structure (e.g., 11pt for paragraph, 15pt for heading 1, 13pt for heading 2).                                  | Using inconsistent font sizes for different sections.                                                                                                  |
| **Heading**                        | Use **heading 1, heading 2, heading 3** to define proper hierarchy for a well-structured, easy-to-read document.                                                | Not using heading tags or using them inappropriately can lead to a poorly structured document.                                                         |
| **Line Spacing**                   | Consistent spacing utilized through line height (e.g., 1.15 or 1.5 spacing).                                                                                   | Random spacing is being used. No consistent and unwanted spacing.                                                                                      |
| **Consistency in Color Usage**     | Use a consistent color palette that aligns with branding guidelines.                                                                                           | Using multiple colors that clash or are not aligned with brand standards.                                                                              |
| **Visual Hierarchy**               | Use **bold**, *italics*, and _underlining_ purposefully to emphasize key points without overusing them.                                                       | Over-correcting with too much emphasis (e.g., bolding everything) can reduce readability.                                                              |
| **Bullet and Numbered Lists**      | Use bullet points for non-sequential items and numbered lists for sequential information. Ensure consistent indentation.                                       | Mixing formats (e.g., bullets followed by numbers) or inconsistent indentation.                                                                        |
| **Table Formatting**               | Use tables for data presentation with consistent column widths and row heights to enhance readability.                                                         | Using tables without borders or inconsistent formatting can lead to a messy appearance.                                                                |
| **Images and Graphics**           | Include relevant images with captions, ensuring high quality and appropriate placement.                                                                        | Including images without context or poor-quality graphics can detract from professionalism.                                                            |
| **Hyperlink Formatting**           | Use descriptive text for hyperlinks (e.g., "Visit our website" instead of "Click here").                                                                       | Using long URLs or vague phrases as links can confuse readers.                                                                                        |
| **Page Layout**                    | Employ consistent margins and indentations to enhance readability.                                                                                             | Inconsistent margins or indentations create a chaotic appearance.                                                                                      |
| **Table of Content Section**       | Titles are formatted consistently, logically ordered, with accurate page numbers, proper indentation, and hyperlinks for easy access.                          | Titles are vague, formatting is inconsistent, entries may be outdated or not hyperlinked.                                                              |
| **Proofreading**                   | Always proofread documents for grammar, typos, and clarity before sharing.                                                                                     | Submitting documents with errors can undermine professionalism.                                                                                        |
| **Feedback Loop**                  | Get the document reviewed for improvement:<br>• QA/Pranit – *Primary touchpoint*<br>• PMO (Sumeet/Shyam) – *Secondary touchpoint*                             | Not reviewing the document can undermine credibility and professionalism.                                                                              |
