Team members are encouraged to refer to the shared template examples that showcase both effective and ineffective formatting styles – [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oir-s-MQssqH54MDqGK9s9jJxNgcutvBGuiepffN87M/edit?usp=sharing)

## Objective

This document emphasizes the importance of consistent branding and hierarchy styling in our internal and client-facing documentation. We have observed that informal or poorly organized documents can lead to frustration and diminished interest in reading.

By adhering to a well-structured format, we aim to enhance clarity and visibility, ensuring that stakeholders remain engaged and can easily navigate the content.

Maintaining these standards helps reflect our commitment to quality and professionalism.

## What’s “Good” Practice?

| **Formatting Element**       | **GOOD Formatting ✅** |
|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| **Axioned’s Logo**          | Positioned prominently at the top-right within the header space, ideally with a width of 1.34 and a height of 0.5 inches. |
| **Footer**                  | Include page numbers in the footer (e.g., "Page X of Y"), center-aligned. |
| **Fonts**                   | Use a consistent font type throughout the document (e.g., IBM Plex Sans, Calibri, Proxima Nova). |
| **Font Size**               | Define hierarchy through font sizes (e.g., 11 for paragraphs, 15 for Heading 1, 13 for Heading 2, etc.). |
| **Heading**                 | Use defined heading levels (H1, H2, H3, etc.) to create a clear document structure. |
| **Line Spacing**            | Maintain consistent line spacing—recommend 1.15 or 1.5 for readability. |
| **Consistency in Color Usage** | Use a consistent color palette that aligns with branding guidelines. |
| **Visual Hierarchy**        | Use bold, italics, and underlining purposefully to guide attention—not decoratively. |
| **Bullet and Numbered Lists** | Use bullet points for non-sequential items and numbered lists for sequential information. Ensure consistent indentation. |
| **Table Formatting**        | Use tables for data presentation with consistent column widths and row heights to enhance readability. |
| **Images and Graphics**     | Use high-quality images with captions where necessary. Position thoughtfully within the layout. |
| **Hyperlink Formatting**    | Use descriptive anchor text (e.g., "Visit our website" instead of "Click here"). |
| **Page Layout**             | Maintain uniform margins and indentations throughout. |
| **Table of Content Section** | Ensure TOC is well-formatted, linked, up-to-date, and clearly reflects document structure. |
| **Proofreading**            | Review all documents for typos, grammatical issues, and clarity before sharing. |
| **Feedback Loop**           | Get the document reviewed for verification and/or improvements:<br> - QA/Pranit — Primary review<br> - PMO (Sumeet/Shyam) — Secondary review |
