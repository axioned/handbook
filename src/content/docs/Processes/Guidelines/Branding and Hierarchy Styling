# Guidelines: Branding and Hierarchy Styling for All Documents

## Objective

This document is to emphasize the importance of consistent branding and hierarchy styling in our internal and client-facing documentation. We have observed that informal or poorly organized documents can lead to frustration and diminished interest in reading. By adhering to a well-structured format, we aim to enhance clarity and visibility, ensuring that stakeholders remain engaged and can easily navigate the content.

By doing so, we can maintain a high standard of documentation that reflects our commitment to quality and professionalism.

### What’s “Good” vs. “Bad” Practice?

| Formatting Element | GOOD ✅ | BAD ❌ |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Axioned’s Logo** | Positioned prominently at the top-right within the header space, ideally with a width of 1.34 and a height of 0.5 inches.  ![][image1] | Placed randomly in the document without regard for layout, such as at the bottom or in the margin. |
| **Footer** | Include page numbers in the footer (e.g., "Page X of Y") center-aligned. | Omitting page numbers or using unclear footers (e.g., only "Page 1" without context). |
| **Fonts** | Use of a consistent font type throughout the document (e.g., IBM Plex Sans, Calibri, Proxima Nova). | Mixed fonts within a single document (e.g., Arial on one section or for a heading, Calibri for paragraphs, Inter for disclaimers and/or notes).    |
| **Font Size** | Use of consistent font sizes based on the hierarchy/structure (e.g., 11 font for paragraph, 15 font for heading 1, 13 font for heading 2, etc). | Not following consistent font sizes to set the hierarchy/structure (e.g., using two different font sizes for paragraphs in different sections). |
| **Heading** | Use **heading 1, heading 2, heading 3,** etc., to define proper hierarchy for a well-structured and easy-to-read document. | Not using any heading tags or inappropriate sequence could lead to a poorly structured document. |
| **Line Spacing** | Consistent spacing utilized through line height (e.g., 1.15, or 1.5 spacing) | Random spacing is being used. No consistent and unwanted spacing is followed.  |
| **Consistency in Color Usage** | Use a consistent color palette that aligns with branding guidelines. | Using multiple colors that clash or are not aligned with brand standards. |
| **Visual Hierarchy** | Use bold, italics, and underlining purposefully to emphasize key points without overusing them. | Over-correcting with too much emphasis (e.g., bolding everything) can reduce readability. |
| **Bullet and Numbered Lists** | Use bullet points for non-sequential items and numbered lists for sequential information. Ensure consistent indentation. | Mixing formats in lists (e.g., bullets followed by numbers) or inconsistent indentation can confuse the reader. |
| **Table Formatting** | Use tables for data presentation with consistent column widths and row heights to enhance readability. | Using tables without borders or inconsistent cell formatting can lead to a messy appearance. |
| **Images and Graphics** | Include relevant images with captions, ensuring high quality and appropriate placement. | Including images without context or poor-quality graphics can detract from professionalism. |
| **Hyperlink Formatting** | Use descriptive text for hyperlinks (e.g., "Visit our website" instead of "Click here"). | Using long URLs as hyperlinks or vague phrases can mislead or confuse readers. |
| **Page Layout** | Employ consistent margins and indentations to enhance readability. | Inconsistent margins or indentations create a chaotic appearance. |
| **Table of Content Section** | Titles are clear, formatted consistently, logically ordered, have accurate page numbers, are properly indented, hyperlinked for easy access, and regularly updated. | Titles are vague, formatting is inconsistent, order is illogical, page numbers are incorrect or missing, indentation is absent, entries are not hyperlinked, and the TOC is outdated. |
| **Proofreading** | Always proofread documents for grammatical errors, typos, and clarity before sharing. | Submitting documents with errors can undermine credibility and professionalism. |
| **Feedback Loop** | Get the document review for verification and/or recommendation on improvements: **QA/Pranit***—Primary touchpoint* **PMO (Sumeet/Shyam)***—Secondary touchpoint* | Not reviewing the document can undermine credibility and professionalism. |

We encourage all team members to refer to the provided templates and documentation that reflect our established guidelines. These resources serve as valuable references to promote consistency and quality in our work. Adhering to these templates will help us maintain our standards and enhance collaboration across our projects.
