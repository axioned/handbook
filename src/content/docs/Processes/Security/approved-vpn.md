## Approved VPNs for Secure Access

To maintain the highest level of security for our systems and data, please use only the following approved VPNs:
  - Office Network (OpenVPN)
  - Surfshark (paid)
  - ExpressVPN (paid)

## Why This Matters

Using only these approved VPNs is crucial because they have been rigorously vetted to meet our company's security and compliance standards. Unapproved VPNs may lack essential encryption, contain vulnerabilities that cybercriminals can exploit, or even be associated with malicious activities. By adhering to our list of approved VPNs, you help ensure that all data transmitted over our network is secure, safeguarding our systems against unauthorized access, data breaches, and other cyber threats.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

Failure to use approved VPNs can have serious repercussions, including exposing our network to security vulnerabilities and potential data breaches. Non-compliance may result in disciplinary action, as it compromises the integrity of our systems and the safety of our data.

## What to Do If You're Unsure

If you are unsure whether a VPN or any other software is safe or approved, follow these steps:

  - Consult the team: Before installing anything, ask in the [#it-support](https://axioned.slack.com/archives/C02TD2MLR) channel. The IT team can confirm whether the software is approved and safe to use.
  - Do your research: If you're curious about a particular tool, conduct preliminary research, but always get final approval from the IT Team before proceeding.
  - Avoid installing unapproved software: Itâ€™s better to wait for confirmation than to risk compromising our security. Installing unapproved software without proper verification can lead to vulnerabilities and potential security breaches.

## Best Practices for VPN Use

To further enhance our network security, please follow these best practices when using an approved VPN:

  - **Keep Software Updated:** Regularly update your VPN software to the latest version to ensure you have the most current security features and fixes.
  - **Use Strong Passwords:** Ensure that your VPN login credentials are strong and unique, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

We are here to support your efforts to stay safe and compliant, so please reach out if you have any questions or concerns.
