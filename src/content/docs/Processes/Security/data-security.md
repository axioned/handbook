## Introduction

We expect all Axioned employees to read and follow the policies and procedures within this document.

The IT Admin team, Sagar Bisen and Ismile B, will work with the Axioned team to ensure that these policies and procedures are followed at all times. 

:::caution
This document contains information regarding policies, regulations, and rules of Axioned. If any breach or threat made by an employee, which can put business/project into risk, for that a proper investigation will take place and if any individual or team found violating the policy strict action can be taken.
:::

## 1. Purpose

Axioned will always try to stay secure from its sophisticated IT infrastructure and also want their employees to be aware regarding the IT threats. It only takes one employee opening a phishing email or letting a crook into the premises for a breach to occur. The purpose of information security policies is to prevent that, providing instructions for staff to follow in various scenarios.

The first step in reducing the role of human error in incidents is to establish an IT & Data Security policy for our employees that states the do's and don'ts of IT & Data security. 

The Axioned IT Team also wants to ensure that employees should get educated about policies, security rules and regulations and apply this to their daily work routine.

## 2. The Importance of IT and Data Security

An IT & Data security policy is a statement, or a collection of statements, designed to guide employees’ behavior with regard to the security of company data, assets, IT systems, etc. 

These IT & Data Security Policies define the who, what, and why regarding the desired behavior, and they play an important role in an organization’s overall IT & Data security posture. 

IT & Data Security Policies should reflect the risk appetite of executive management and therefore serve to establish an associated security mindset within an organization.

IT & Data security Policies are important in an organization to bring some level of discipline in the employees who use the IT resources daily. Working with IT resources is always a threat to the IT Infrastructure, so IT & Data Security Policies are important in an organization to make sure our IT Infrastructure doesn’t get infected

## 3. Computer or Device Use Regulation

All devices, workstations, laptops, phones, etc., used by Axioned Employees should be used with careful consideration. 

Axioned Employees should take the necessary actions and measures to ensure that any devices that they use in association with their work do not get infected by foreign threats/malware or other such viruses.

## 4. Credentials and Access to Systems Management:

### 4.1 Use Strong passwords

Always use a strong password generator when creating accounts at work. Use generators like [Norton Password Generator](https://my.norton.com/extspa/passwordmanager?path=pwd-gen) or [LastPass Generator](https://www.lastpass.com/features/password-generator#generatorTool).

### 4.2 Change passwords where necessary

The frequency of changing a password depends on what the passwords are used for. If it's used for Server access and if you have shared with someone, then definitely change/update is a must, ask IT Team to update the password and specify the reason for change.

### 4.3 Use 2-factor Authentication - Mandatory

Activating 2-factor authentication for any a/c is good and provides an extra shield to your a/c. Please just make sure to inform the IT Team phone/email-id used for setting up 2-way authentication for organization records. 

### 4.4 Store your credentials and keys securely

You can use a password manager to securely store your passwords, or use Google sheet to store and manage (update accordingly for any changes/new password) but make sure the sheet is only shared and owned by an individual and not open to everyone.

  - **Credential Auditing**
    - The IT Team conducts an audit of individual Client project credentials on a monthly basis.
    - IT Team ensures that every team member who works with tools has multi-factor authentication (MFA) or two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled where possible.
    - Ensure to set expiration date for temporary backups in google drive. How to do?
  - **Access Control**
    - Implement technical safeguards such as MFA and screensavers that lock to secure access to these systems.
    - Regularly monitor access logs to detect and prevent unauthorized access attempts.
    - Established policies/checklist for revoking access in a timely manner when team members leave or change roles.
  - **To be achieved**
    - Ensure that access to computers and systems used to access Client data is limited to authorized personnel, through VMs setup to access Client Servers, Tools, etc.
    - Implement best practices for storing and securing credentials, such as using password management tools and avoiding storing them in unsecured locations such as an excel spreadsheet or on a piece of paper. The team is currently following this to a certain extent, but it is recommended that they consider implementing a more robust process. 

## 5. Data Security

At Axioned we must always make sure that the data and information we’re working with - our own and our Clients - is protected and secured.

We wish to prevent any/all of the following with respect to our own and/or Client data:
- With respect to Client data/information: Only the formally/officially approved (via email) Axioned Employees should have access to such data
- With respect to Axioned data/information: Only Axioned employees should have access, unless specifically/formally approved otherwise

Data and information here can mean any of the following:
- Data/information we have access to via the platforms, tools or applications our Clients use - e.g. Google drive, Cloud Servers, JIRA, Slack, etc.
- Data/information we have access to via the platforms, tools or applications we/Axioned  use - e.g. Google drive, Cloud Servers, GoDaddy, etc.

### 5.1 Guidelines for Axioned Employees and Axioned IT Team

  - **Handling Client Data**
    - We ensure that data received from the Client for reference is only viewable and after work, the Client is asked to revoke access.
    - If data received from a Client needs to be modified, we attempt to obtain cloud editing access. We also make sure that data from the local system is deleted after work is completed.
    - Downloading/Uploading data from platforms is not allowed as it violates data security. Please note that a log is generated for every activity.

### 5.3 Data Deletion Management

As an IT software and QA service provider, it is important to ensure that Client data is not left around after the project is completed. This is especially important for both time-bound and retainer projects. The following processes and guidelines will ensure that data is properly deleted and security is maintained.

  - **Project Closure**
    - Once a project is completed, the project manager (PM) will send an email to the IT Team to initiate the project closure process.

  - **Checklist and Audits**
    - The IT Team will follow the project closure checklist, which includes audits of user GDrive and systems to ensure that all data is deleted when it is no longer needed.

  - **User Exit Checklist**
    - The IT Team will also follow the user exit checklist to delete/format user systems and check for any data that needs to be deleted.
    - Once the IT team completes the user exit checklist, they will send a final sign-off email to the HR team, indicating that the employee exit process can proceed. 

  - **Timely Implementation**
    - The IT Team will determine a timeline for implementation and assign an owner for this initiative.

  - **Best Practices Recommendation**
    - In addition to these processes, the IT Team may consider implementing best practices such as using password manager tools, periodic data audits, and establishing a data retention policy. These steps will help improve data security and minimize the risk of data breaches.

### 5.4 Additional pointers can be followed by authorized individuals for data security

  - Encryption/password-protection of file during data transfer/sharing: Implementing encryption of Client data stored in the system using password protected zip file, to provide an extra layer of security.
  - Access Control: Implementing strict access control measures such as multi-factor authentication tools and application of Clients to ensure that only authorized personnel can access Client data.
  - Training and awareness: Providing training to the team members working on Client data, to increase their awareness of the importance of data security and the measures in place to protect it.
