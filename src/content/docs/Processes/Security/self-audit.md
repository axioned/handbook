Some of the most well known tools to run security checks on your websites are:

- Mozilla Observatory <https://observatory.mozilla.org/>
- Security Headers <https://securityheaders.com/>
- Snyk Website Vulnerability Scanner <https://snyk.io/website-scanner/>
- Sucuri SiteCheck <https://sitecheck.sucuri.net/>

Each of these tools return their assessment of the website based on various parameters (and often return scores/grades). Most importantly, they also provide remidial measures and suggestions for you to act on.

It is advised, and required, to run these as part of Maintenance Activities as well as during the Go-live process.
