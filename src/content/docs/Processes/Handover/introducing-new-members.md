This document is intended to help new members get up to speed with a new project and team. It is also intended to help the client and team get to know the new member, their strengths and focus areas.

## For time-sensitive handovers

- **Identify** the new team member
- Layout and **communicate the onboarding and the communication plan** (with timelines) to the [PMO team](mailto:pmo@axioned.com) (or [GitHub issues](https://github.com/axioned/plan/issues/new))
- **Training period** (usually 2 weeks)
- **Introduction call** - Introduce to the client and communicate the high-level onboarding plan.
  - *Example: `Today we just wanted to make introductions. We'll follow-up with the plan and timelines on email.`*
  - Being visible (on camera) to the client helps build trust.
  - Having your Project Manager / Account Manager or a member of the PMO team on the call is important.
- **Formally communicate the plan:** Directly post introduction call, send an email to the client with the introduction and onboarding plan with timelines.
  - Ensure the email is concise, specific and elicit's confidence in our onboarding plan.
- **Overlap period** (of usually 2 weeks) where the new person is doing the actual work (~30% of the work) and the previous person is reviewing and doing the rest (~70% of the actual work)
  - 1-2 internal review checkpoints
- **Ask for feedback** from the client (in around 2 weeks from the start of the overlap period)
  - Having the Project Manager, Account Manager or a member of the PMO team be here often helps too.
  - Manage the feedback loop (with the client) and ensure the client is happy with the new member.
- Complete the transition and confirmation

:::tip[In the overlap period]
The new member should be doing the actual work, not just shadowing the previous person.

:::danger
Step back and really think about the communication plan. **It is as much as about technical onboarding as it is about communication with the client.**

## For non-time-sensitive handovers

The same as above, but without the time pressure.
