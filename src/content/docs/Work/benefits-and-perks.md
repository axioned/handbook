## Paid Sick Time (Unplanned Leaves)

We understand that a sick day is never fun. But when you’re sick, you’re sick. We trust you to take the time you need to get better.

- When you’re sick, please notify the team as soon as you know you’ll be out, and for how long you expect to be out for.
- We offer 10 days of paid unplanned leaves a year. Similar to Planned Leaves, these are prorated based on your start date during your first year at Axioned.
- If you are going to be away from work due to illness or injury for more than 3 consecutive days (or both sides of a weekend), you may be required to file a medical report clearing you to be able to resume work.
- Your manager will check in with you if you’re taking frequent unplanned sick days. Excessive use of sick time may result in disciplinary measures.
- Axioned does not pay out for unused sick time upon resignation or termination.

:::note
If you have a medical condition that you know will take you away from work regularly, please work with your People Ops team and your manager.

## Public Holidays and Observances

- While may differ every year, we typically have ~13 local public holidays and observances in a year. You can find the list of public holidays [here](/docs/Work/holidays).
- These are days when the office is closed, and you are not expected to work.
- If you are required to work on a public holiday, you will be given a day off in lieu.
- Unused public holidays are not paid out upon resignation or termination.

## Day in Lieu (Compensatory Time Off)

- If you are required to work on a holiday, you will be given a day off in lieu.
- This day off is to be taken within 60 days of the public holiday.
- If you are unable to take the day off within 60 days, these days will be forfeited.
- Any unused compensatory time off are not encashed should you leave Axioned.

## Gratuity and Insurance

At Axioned, you are eligible for gratuity per the local governance. Employees also have the option to stay opted-in into Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) scheme as well as Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) coverage.

## Employee Referrals

Axioned offers financial rewards for successful employee referrals that really motivates the team to bring in talented new hires. It not only helps in finding great candidates but also boosts morale and engagement among the current employees.

For Axioned employees who refer someone: If your referral is a trainee, you'll get ₹2,000 when they start, and another ₹2,000 after they've been here for 4 months, totaling ₹4,000. If they're experienced and need no training, you'll get ₹4,000 when they start and ₹6,000 after 4 months, totaling ₹10,000.

For non-Axioned folks who refer someone: If your referral is a trainee, you'll receive ₹3,000 when they start, totaling ₹3,000. If they're experienced, you'll get ₹6,000 when they start, totaling ₹6,000. These rewards are paid once the new hire starts working and are recognized at our next Axioned Town Hall.
