A guide to all of the terms we use internally.

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Handbook | This website üòé |
| WOW | Impressing and exceeding the expectations of a client (or a teammate) |
| Sprint | A period of time in which we work on a project. Usually 2 weeks |
| Standup (SU) | A meeting in which we discuss what we are working on |
| Lessons Learned (Retro) | A meeting in which we discuss what went well (WWW) and what would be even better if (EBI) |
| Monorepo | Multiple projects (e.g. app, docs and API) all in one GitHub repository |
| Commit | Addition of code, pushed into a branch on the versioning system (GitHub, etc) |
| Pull request (PR) | The way in which code is reviewed and then added to the codebase. A PR is made of commits |
| Merge | If a PR is good, it is merged, which accepts the changes and ‚Äòmerges‚Äô them into the codebase |
| i18n | Internationalisation, the process of making the app available in multiple languages |
| a11y | Accessibility, the process of making the app available to people with disabilities |
| CI | Continuous Integration, the process of automatically testing code |
| CD | Continuous Deployment, the process of automatically deploying code |
| PO | Product Owner, someone who manages the product |
| UX | User Experience, the process of designing the app |
| UI | User Interface, the process of designing the app |
| E2E | End to end testing. Essentially a robot that checks if our application is working each time we push code |
| Linting | A tool that checks code for errors and formatting |
| Metadata | Data that is in a computer readable format, like JSON, which looks like `{"team": Liverpool", "ucl": "6"}` |
| CMS (Content Management System) | Think of it like WordPress. It lets you manage a website‚Äôs content‚Äîtext, images, videos‚Äîwithout needing to know how to code. You can log in, click buttons, and update your website, just like editing a document in Word. |
| CRM (Customer Relationship Management) | Like a digital address book that not only stores contacts but also keeps track of your relationship with them‚Äîemails, calls, sales, notes, etc. It helps sales and support teams stay organized and informed. |
| DNS (Domain Name System) | DNS is the internet's phonebook. When you type a website name (like google.com), DNS translates it into the actual IP address (like 192.168.0.1) of the server. You never see the numbers‚Äîit just works. |
| CDN (Content Delivery Network) | A network of servers around the world that store copies of your website‚Äôs static files (images, videos, etc.) and deliver them to users from the nearest server. Makes sites load faster globally. |
| API (Application Programming Interface) | Imagine a waiter in a restaurant‚Äîyou (the frontend) tell the waiter (the API) what you want, and they fetch it from the kitchen (the backend). APIs let different systems talk to each other securely and efficiently. |
| OAuth | A secure way to log in to one service using another. For example, ‚ÄúLogin with Google.‚Äù You don‚Äôt give your password to the new site; Google verifies you. |
| ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) | It‚Äôs a way to move data from one place to another, clean it up along the way, and store it in a new system. Think of it like taking messy spreadsheets, tidying them, and putting them into a new report. |
| SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) | Think of it as a security guard‚Äôs dashboard. It collects logs from multiple systems and alerts if something suspicious is happening‚Äîlike someone trying to hack into your server. |
| Middleware | Like a translator at the UN. When different systems need to talk but speak different ‚Äúlanguages,‚Äù middleware makes sure they understand each other. It keeps systems connected and data flowing smoothly. |
| Load Balancer | It‚Äôs like a traffic cop for your servers. If too many users hit your website at once, the load balancer spreads them out so no single server crashes. |
| Frontend | What users see and interact with‚Äîbuttons, menus, forms. It‚Äôs the face of the application, like the outside of a vending machine. |
| Backend | Where the data and logic live‚Äîwhat happens behind the scenes when you click something. Like the vending machine‚Äôs machinery responding to your button press. |
| Deployment | Making a website or application live and accessible on the internet. Like taking a car from the factory and delivering it to a showroom. |
| CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) | A way for developers to regularly push out small updates to code in a safe and automated way. Like a bakery restocking fresh bread every hour without shutting down the store. |
| Regression Testing | After fixing a bug or adding a new feature, this ensures old parts of the software still work. Like checking that a car‚Äôs brakes still work after installing a new radio. |
| Web Accessibility (a11y) | Ensuring your website works for people with disabilities‚Äîscreen readers, color contrast, keyboard navigation. It‚Äôs like installing ramps and braille in a public building. |
| Analytics (Google Analytics, Clarity, etc.) | Tools that track what users do on your website‚Äîwhere they click, how long they stay, etc. It‚Äôs like observing customers in a store to understand their behavior. |
| SEO (Search Engine Optimization) | Making your website easy to find via Google. It‚Äôs like making sure your business is listed correctly in a phonebook and is appealing to customers. |
| DevOps | A way of working where developers and operations (infrastructure) collaborate closely, usually using automation, to build and run applications quickly and reliably. |
| SaaS (Software as a Service) | Software you access over the internet without installing anything‚Äîlike Google Docs, Zoom, or Netflix. You just subscribe and use. |
| Version Control (Git) | A system that tracks changes to code over time, allowing teams to collaborate safely. Like Google Docs‚Äô version history, but for developers. |
| Staging Environment | A testing ground that mirrors the live site. Used to check new changes before pushing them live. Like rehearsing a play before the real show. |
| Email Spoofing | This is when someone sends emails that look like they‚Äôre from your company‚Äôs email address‚Äîeven though they‚Äôre not. It‚Äôs often used to trick people into sharing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links. Think of it as forgery in the digital world. |
| DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) | This adds a digital signature to your outgoing emails. It‚Äôs like sealing a letter with your unique stamp so the recipient knows it‚Äôs really from you and hasn‚Äôt been tampered with. |
| SPF (Sender Policy Framework) | A list you publish online that tells email providers which servers are allowed to send email from your domain. It‚Äôs like telling the post office: ‚ÄúOnly these people can send mail in my name.‚Äù |
| DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) | A rule that works with SPF and DKIM. It tells email systems what to do if someone tries to spoof your domain and also gives you reports so you can monitor attempts. |
| Cache / Caching | Storing frequently used data so it loads faster the next time. Like keeping your favorite mug by the coffee machine instead of the cupboard. |
| Containerization (Docker, etc.) | Packaging up code and everything it needs to run so it works the same on any computer. Like shipping your dish with the stove and ingredients included. |
| Webhooks | A way for one system to instantly notify another when something happens. Like getting a text alert when your package is delivered. |
| Latency | The time it takes for data to travel from one point to another. Like the delay you hear in a long-distance call. |
| Throughput | How much data can be processed or transferred in a given time. Like the number of cars a highway can handle per hour. |
