Some of the most well known tools to run security checks on your websites are:

- PageSpeed Insights https://pagespeed.web.dev/ (you also get the field data here)
- WebPageTest https://www.webpagetest.org/ (very helpful with suggestions and improvement areas as well ability to manage regions and devices)
- Search Console https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9205520 (must do)

You can check out other sources and when to use one vs. not over at https://web.dev/vitals-tools/

It is advised, and required, to run these as part of Maintenance Activities as well as during the Go-live process.
