As development environments have accelerated, version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter. They are especially useful for DevOps teams since they help them to reduce development time and increase successful deployments. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database.

If you use the less than (&lt;) or greater than (&gt;) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags. Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML. For Example - $company = htmlentities(trim($_POST['company']), ENT_COMPAT); $services = htmlentities(trim($_POST['services']), ENT_COMPAT); How to check htmlentities() developer has used or not?

It MUST NOT use the other tag variations. 13\tFiles 13.1\tAll PHP files MUST use the Unix LF (line feed) line ending. 13.2\tAll PHP files MUST end with a single blank line. 13.3\tThe closing ?&gt; tag MUST be omitted from files containing only PHP. 14\tLines 14.1\tThere MUST NOT be a hard limit on line length. 14.2\tThe soft limit on line length MUST be 120 characters; automated style checkers MUST warn but MUST NOT error at the soft limit. 14.3\tLines SHOULD NOT be longer than 80 characters; lines longer than that SHOULD be split into multiple subsequent lines of no more than 80 characters each. 14.4\tThere MUST NOT be trailing whitespace at the end of non-blank lines. 14.5\tBlank lines MAY be added to improve readability and to indicate related blocks of code. 14.6\tThere MUST NOT be more than one statement per line. 15\tIndentation 15.1\tCode MUST use an indent of 4 spaces for each indent level, and MUST NOT use tabs for indenting. 16\tNamespace and Use Declaration 16.1\tNamespace Declaration\tIf present, is there one blank line after the namespace declaration? Are all the use declarations written after the namespace declaration? 16.2\tUse Declaration\tThere MUST be one use keyword per declaration. 16.3\tThere MUST be one blank line after the all use block.\tFor example: &lt;?php namespace Vendor\\Package;use FooClass;use BarClass as Bar;use OtherVendor\\OtherPackage\\BazClass; 17\tExtends and Implements 17.1\tDeclaration\tThe extends and implements keywords MUST be declared on the same line as the class name. 17.2\tClass Declaration\tThe opening brace for the class MUST go on its own line; the closing brace for the class MUST go on the next line after the body. 18\tProperties 18.1\tVisibility MUST be declared on all properties.\tAre the properties defined by prefixing the declaration with the keywords public, protected or private? 18.2\tAvoid var keyword for property\tHas var keyword used to declare a property? 18.3\tAvoid more than one property per statement\tAre there more than one property declared per statement? 18.4\tProperty name\tProperty names SHOULD NOT be prefixed with a single underscore to indicate protected or private visibility. 18.5\tA property declaration looks like the following.\tExample: &lt;?php namespace Vendor\\Package; class ClassName { public $foo = null; } 19\tMethods 19.1\tVisibility declaration on all methods.\tAre the methods defined by prefixing the declaration with the keywords public, protected or private? A method declaration looks like the following. Note the placement of parentheses, commas, spaces, and braces: Example: &lt;?php namespace Vendor\\Package; class ClassName { public function fooBarBaz($arg1, &amp;$arg2, $arg3 = []) { // method body } } 19.2\tMethod names\tMethod names SHOULD NOT be prefixed with a single underscore to indicate protected or private visibility. 19.3\tMethod Declaration\tMethod names MUST NOT be declared with a space after the method name. The opening brace MUST go on its own line, and the closing brace MUST go on the next line following the body. 19.4\tMethod parenthesis\tThere MUST NOT be a space after the opening parenthesis, and there MUST NOT be a space before the closing parenthesis. 20\tMethod Arguments 20.1\tArguments Declaration\tIn the argument list, there MUST NOT be a space before each comma, and there MUST be one space after each comma. 20.2\tArguments with default value\tMethod arguments with default values MUST go at the end of the argument list. Example: &lt;?php namespace Vendor\\Package; class ClassName { public function foo($arg1, &amp;$arg2, $arg3 = []) { // method body } } 21\tAbstract, final, and static 21.1\tWhen present, the abstract and final declarations MUST precede the visibility declaration.\tAre the they defined by prefixing the declaration with the keywords public, protected or private? 21.2\tWhen present, the static declaration MUST come after the visibility declaration.\tExample: &lt;?php namespace Vendor\\Package; abstract class ClassName { protected static $foo; abstract protected function zim(); final public static function bar() { // method body } } 22\tMethod and Function Calls 22.1\tWhen making a method or function call, there MUST NOT be a space between the method or function name and the opening parenthesis, there MUST NOT be a space after the opening parenthesis, and there MUST NOT be a space before the closing parenthesis. In the argument list, there MUST NOT be a space before each comma, and there MUST be one space after each comma.\tExample: &lt;?php bar(); $foo-&gt;bar($arg1); Foo::bar($arg2, $arg3); Argument lists MAY be split across multiple lines, where each subsequent line is indented once. When doing so, the first item in the list MUST be on the next line, and there MUST be only one argument per line. &lt;?php $foo-&gt;bar( $longArgument, $longerArgument, $muchLongerArgument ); 23\tControl Structures 23.1\tThere MUST be one space after the control structure keyword 23.2\tThere MUST NOT be a space after the opening parenthesis 23.3\tThere MUST NOT be a space before the closing parenthesis 23.4\tThere MUST be one space between the closing parenthesis and the opening brace 23.5\tThe structure body MUST be indented once 23.6\tThe closing brace MUST be on the next line after the body 24\tClosures 24.1\tClosures MUST be declared with a space after the function keyword, and a space before and after the use keyword.\tA closure declaration looks like the following. Note the placement of parentheses, commas, spaces, and braces: &lt;?php $closureWithArgs = function ($arg1, $arg2) { // body }; $closureWithArgsAndVars = function ($arg1, $arg2) use ($var1, $var2) { // body }; 24.2\tThe opening brace MUST go on the same line, and the closing brace MUST go on the next line following the body. 24.3\tThere MUST NOT be a space after the opening parenthesis of the argument list or variable list, and there MUST NOT be a space before the closing parenthesis of the argument list or variable list. 24.4\tIn the argument list and variable list, there MUST NOT be a space before each comma, and there MUST be one space after each comma. 24.5\tClosure arguments with default values MUST go at the end of the argument list.\tA closure declaration looks like the following. Note the placement of parentheses, commas, spaces, and braces: &lt;?php $closureWithArgs = function ($arg1, $arg2) { // body }; $closureWithArgsAndVars = function ($arg1, $arg2) use ($var1, $var2) { // body }; 24.6\tArgument lists and variable lists MAY be split across multiple lines, where each subsequent line is indented once. When doing so, the first item in the list MUST be on the next line, and there MUST be only one argument or variable per line. When the ending list (whether or arguments or variables) is split across multiple lines, the closing parenthesis and opening brace MUST be placed together on their own line with one space between them.\tThe following are examples of closures with and without argument lists and variable lists split across multiple lines. &lt;?php $longArgs_noVars = function ( $longArgument, $longerArgument, $muchLongerArgument ) { // body }; $noArgs_longVars = function () use ( $longVar1, $longerVar2, $muchLongerVar3 ) { // body }; $longArgs_longVars = function ( $longArgument, $longerArgument, $muchLongerArgument ) use ( $longVar1, $longerVar2, $muchLongerVar3 ) { // body }; $longArgs_shortVars = function ( $longArgument, $longerArgument, $muchLongerArgument ) use ($var1) { // body }; $shortArgs_longVars = function ($arg) use ( $longVar1, $longerVar2, $muchLongerVar3 ) { // body }; Note that the formatting rules also apply when the closure is used directly in a function or method call as an argument. &lt;?php $foo-&gt;bar( $arg1, function ($arg2) use ($var1) { // body }, $arg3 ); 25\tIncluding Code 25.1\tAnywhere you are unconditionally including a class file, use require_once. Anywhere you are conditionally including a class file (for example, factory methods), use include_once. Either of these will ensure that class files are included only once. They share the same file list, so you don't need to worry about mixing them - a file included with require_once will not be included again by include_once. 26\tNaming Conventions 27\tGlobal Variables and Functions 27.1\tIf your package needs to define global variables, their names should start with a single underscore followed by the package name and another underscore. For example, the PEAR package uses a global variable called $_PEAR_destructor_object_list. 27.2\tGlobal functions should be named using the &quot;studly caps&quot; style (also referred to as &quot;bumpy case&quot; or &quot;camel caps&quot;). In addition, they should have the package name as a prefix, to avoid name collisions between packages. The initial letter of the name (after the prefix) is lowercase, and each letter that starts a new &quot;word&quot; is capitalized.\tAn example: XML_RPC_serializeData() 28\tClasses 28.1\tClasses should be given descriptive names. Avoid using abbreviations where possible. Class names should always begin with an uppercase letter. The PEAR class hierarchy is also reflected in the class name, each level of the hierarchy separated with a single underscore.\tExamples of good class names are: Log Net_Gear HTML_Upload_Error 29\tClass Variables and Methods 29.1\tClass variables (a.k.a properties) and methods should be named using the &quot;studly caps&quot; style (also referred to as &quot;bumpy case&quot; or &quot;camel caps&quot;).\tSome examples (these would be &quot;&quot;public&quot;&quot; members): Example: $counter, connect() Private class members are preceded by a single underscore. Example: _sort(), _initTree(), $_status Protected class members are not preceded by a single underscore. Example: protected $somevar, protected function initTree() 30\tConstants 30.1\tConstants should always be all-uppercase, with underscores to separate words. Prefix constant names with the uppercase name of the class/package they are used in.\tExample: DB_DATASOURCENAME 31\tArrays 31.1\tAssignments in arrays may be aligned. When splitting array definitions onto several lines, the last value may also have a trailing comma.\tThis is valid PHP syntax and helps to keep code diffs minimal: &lt;?php $some_array = array( 'foo' =&gt; 'bar', 'spam' =&gt; 'ham', );?&gt; 32\tStrings 32.1\tIn general, we use single quotes to enclose literal strings.\tExample: $vision = 'Inspiring people to share'; 32.2\tIf you'd like to insert values from variables, concatenate strings.\tExample: $message = 'Hey ' . $name .

Process Groups are independent of project phases. Project management processes are grouped into the following five Project Management Process Groups: Initiating Process Group. Those processes performed to define a new project or a new phase of an existing project by obtaining authorization to start the project or phase. Planning Process Group. Those processes required to establish the scope of the project, refine the objectives, and define the course of action required to attain the objectives that the project was undertaken to achieve. Executing Process Group. Those processes performed to complete the work defined in the project management plan to satisfy the project requirements. Monitoring and Controlling Process Group. Those processes required to track, review, and regulate the progress and performance of the project; identify any areas in which changes to the plan are required; and initiate the corresponding changes. Closing Process Group. Those processes performed to formally complete or close the project, phase, or contract. These process groups are interrelated and overlap through the project life cycle, but they are distinct and unique in their objectives and their focus on specific activities.

It is a completely different new version of Google Analytics, it works on event-driven based models, and comes with a different set of reports. Reporting Interface There are different sets of reports in your GA4 view, and a limited number of reports are generated. As many of the reports are generated only when we start tracking events.The reporting interface of the GA4 view looks similar to that of Google Analytics for Firebase (because GA4 is built on Firebase analytics). Measurement model GA3 (aka Universal Analytics) uses the measurement model based on sessions and pageviews. Whereas, GA4 uses the measurement model based on events and parameters. GA3 uses a session-based model to track data. GA4 uses an event-based model to track data. Tracking IDs GA4 use the measurement ID.GA4 use the tracking ID. For More details please refer this doc Benefits of GA4 over GA3(aka Universal Analytics Google Analytics 4 (GA4) (also referred to as ‘apps + web’) is the latest version of Google Analytics. GA4 is much more advanced and follows an event-based architecture. Unlike Universal Analytics where we have page views and events, GA4 tracks everything as an event. For example, page views, session start, transactions, etc. are sent as events in GA4. So everything we track in GA4 is an event. GA4 provides a platform for both website and mobile app One of the biggest benefits of GA4 is that we can use it for your website and app, as well as both website and mobile app together.Under one property we can have multiple data streams like Android, iOS and web. GA4 user interface is much more user-centric In Universal Analytics, we have user buckets such as audience, acquisition, behavior, and conversion.Whereas in GA4 we have user buckets like acquisition, engagement, monetization, and retention. These buckets are more aligned with user-oriented reports and marketer’s goals. For More details please refer this doc GA4 Setup Step 1: Create a Google Analytics Account and setup property.Step 2: Upgrade UA to GA4 Default events that are tracked in GA4 There are three types of event parameters in Google Analytics 4 Automatically Collected ParametersCustom ParametersUser Properties Automatically Collected Parameters. Some parameters are automatically collected by GA4. Such parameters are called automatically-collected parameters. For example, by default, GA4 records the following parameters with every event: languagepage_locationpage_referrerpage_titlescreen_resolution How to see automatically-collected parameters in GA4 reports? Follow the steps below: Step-1: Navigate to your GA4 reporting view. Step-2: Click on ‘Events’ (under ‘Engagement’). Step-3: Scroll down and then click on an event name. Let’s click on the ‘page_view’ event. we should now see the detailed report about the ‘page_view’ event. Step-4: Click on the ‘PARAMETER NAME’ drop-down menu on the right-hand side. Step-5: Scroll down the drop-down list and then we should be able to see all the automatically collected parameters. How to track events based on default parameters and custom parameters for Custom events - Custom Definitions Create new dimensions and metrics from event parameters We can set up custom dimensions and metrics that get their values from the event parameters that we collect for your property. We can create an Author dimension that gets its values from the author parameter and an Article_Length metric that gets its value from the number_of_pages parameter. Event and user scope: A custom dimension has either an event scope or user scope. Event scope: In the example above, we would create the Author dimension to have an event scope.User scope: Create user-scoped custom dimensions to identify static or slowly changing attributes of your users, such as &quot;spender=true&quot;, &quot;profession=engineer&quot;, or &quot;favorite_team=Real Madrid&quot;.A custom metric always has an event scope. Limits We can create up to. 50 custom dimensions and 50 custom metrics per property25 uniquely named user-scoped custom dimensions If we have reached your quota but need to create new custom dimensions and/or metrics, we can archive the ones we are no longer using.To see the total number of custom dimensions and metrics you've created, click Custom definitions under Configure (in the left navigation), then click Quota information (top right). Create a custom dimension: Click Custom definitions under Configure (in the left navigation), then click Create custom dimensions: Enter the Dimension name.Select a Scope from the drop-down menu (Event or User).Enter a Description for your custom dimension.Select an Event parameter (event scope) or User property (user scope) from the list or enter the name of a parameter/property you'll collect in the future.Click Save.we will see a value of &quot;not set&quot; for a custom dimension during the first 48 hours. Create a custom metric: Click Custom definitions under Configure (in the left navigation), click the Custom metrics tab, then click Create custom metrics: Enter Metric name.Enter a Description for your custom metric.Select an Event parameter from the list or enter the name of a parameter you'll collect in the future.Choose a Unit of measurement from the drop-down menu. When we select Currency as the unit of measure, we must also identify the custom metric as a cost and/or revenue metric. When we identify the custom metric as a cost and/or revenue metric, then we can restrict access to it when we configure user roles that restrict access to cost and/or revenue metrics.Click Save.It takes 24-48 hours for custom metrics to be populated with data. Edit a custom dimension or metric: Click Custom definitions under Configure (in the left navigation), click the Custom metrics tab, then click Create custom metrics: Click Custom definitions under Configure (in the left navigation)In the row for the dimension or metric, click More, then click Edit.Make the changes we want, then click Save. Archive a custom dimension or metric: Archiving a custom dimension or metric affects any audiences, explorations, or segments that are based on that dimension or metric. Click Custom definitions under Configure (in the left navigation)In the row for the dimension or metric, click , then Archive. we see a list of the other entities in Analytics (e.g., audiences, explorations) that use the custom definition.This change can't be undone and the corresponding data can't be restored. Audiences When we archive a custom dimension or metric that is used in the definition of an audience, that audience definition becomes invalid and the audience doesn't accumulate any snew users.Historical data for the audience is preserved, but no new data is generated once the audience becomes invalid.we cannot export invalid audiences to other products (e.g., Google Ads, Optimize).If you've previously exported the audience to other products, the audience will continue to function as expected. However, since the audience is not accumulating new users, the user count will drop as the membership duration expires for existing users until the audience contains no users.

(This is an action runner -&gt; the actions mentioned in the script will be run on) In our case, we used the latest version of ubuntu (you can use the self-hosted or any other inbuild versions from GitHub, etc) But as we have to execute some ssh and other commands so we used ubuntu with the latest version as an example Post that we have declared all the steps for our action runner to execute once the trigger is hit uses: here we have declared checkouts v2 action It is an official GitHub Action used to check out a repository so a workflow can access it. Then we have given a name to the current job as “Rsync to WP Engine Dev Env” This will be visible while the build is running env: then we have set some environment variables which we will be using further for server connection and the deployment dest: here we used the destination variable for storing the server details this can be found on the hosting dashboard like WPEngine/AWS etc.Syntax -&gt; username@remote_host(IP/Domain_name)while adding destination make sure you add the correct path for the deployment (where needs to be copied/deployed the entire repo as mentioned in the script)In our example, the site was installed at /sites/dev123v/ the entire wp setup and their files run: then we will proceed with the actual command that needs to be executed by action runner on the latest ubuntu as we declared in the above code Here we are executing multiple commands in series in order to deploy files from the GitHub repository to the development server echo: using this line we are saving/creating a private key file which will be required to establish a connection between the GitHub ubuntu machine and the development server further In our example, DEV_DEPLOY_KEY_PRIVATE this variable was used in the scriptThis needs to be created on GitHub under Settings -&gt; Secrets -&gt; Action (If not visible please contact the IT team/Sagar for access)The private key you can download it from the server using your hosting login chmod: setting up the proper permissions to the filersync: using this command we are transferring the files from the GitHub repository to the actual development server over an ssh connection For more information about rsync, ssh commands and there usage you can check these Official linksrsync ssh As you noticed in the above code we have excluded a few of the directories and files similarly you can add if any file/folder needs to be excluded in a deployment like a config file etc. In the end, we are deleting the cache folder (this is optional only if the cache is stored on a server in that case we can execute this) **NOTE:** As we saw in the above script consists of a single trigger which is attached on push action on the staging branch similarly you can write for multiple branches separate code for the production server and separate for the staging server _(recommended in that case create separate files ex. **prod.yml** and **dev.yml** files)_ "},{"title":"netlify","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/processes/delivery/Continous/Managed/netlify","content":"netlify TODO","keywords":""},{"title":"regression","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/processes/delivery/Phased/regression","content":"regression TODO","keywords":""},{"title":"go-live","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/processes/delivery/Phased/go-live","content":"go-live TODO","keywords":""},{"title":"self-qa","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/processes/delivery/Phased/self-qa","content":"self-qa TODO","keywords":""},{"title":"Checklist Pointer for Oversee/Senior Dev","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/processes/Guidelines/oversee-checklist","content":"Checklist Pointer for Oversee/Senior Dev Access Control: Limit access to WP Engine to Oversee or senior developers.Keep server access credentials separate from common credential documents.Maintain limited member access to ensure security.

Google has provided a number of tools over the years to measure and report on performance. Some developers are experts at using these tools, while others have found the abundance of both tools and metrics challenging to keep up with. Site owners should not have to be performance gurus in order to understand the quality of experience they are delivering to their users. The Web Vitals initiative aims to simplify the landscape, and help sites focus on the metrics that matter most, the Core Web Vitals. "},{"title":"Core Web Vitals​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Measuring Core Web Vitals","url":"/docs/processes/performance/measuring-core-web-vitals#core-web-vitals","content":"Core Web Vitals Core Web Vitals are the subset of Web Vitals that apply to all web pages, should be measured by all site owners, and will be surfaced across all Google tools. Each of the Core Web Vitals represents a distinct facet of the user experience, is measurable in the field, and reflects the real-world experience of a critical user-centric outcome. "},{"title":"The metrics​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Measuring Core Web Vitals","url":"/docs/processes/performance/measuring-core-web-vitals#the-metrics","content":"The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds): Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading.First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of 100 milliseconds or less.Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of 0.1. or less. For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. In other words, if at least 75 percent of page views to a site meet the &quot;good&quot; threshold, the site is classified as having &quot;good&quot; performance for that metric. Conversely, if at least 25 percent of page views meet the &quot;poor&quot; threshold, the site is classified as having &quot;poor&quot; performance. So, for example, a 75th percentile LCP of 2 seconds is classified as &quot;good&quot;, while a 75th percentile LCP of 5 seconds is classified as &quot;poor&quot;.

Acceptable practices Cloning of the Git repository to work on the local system and pushing changes to the repository is acceptable.Downloading data to work offline on tools is acceptable. Handling Client Data We ensure that data received from the Client for reference is only viewable and after work, the Client is asked to revoke access.If data received from a Client needs to be modified, we attempt to obtain cloud editing access. We also make sure that data from the local system is deleted after work is completed.Downloading/Uploading data from platforms is not allowed as it violates data security.

This is especially important for both time-bound and retainer projects. The following processes and guidelines will ensure that data is properly deleted and security is maintained. Project Closure Once a project is completed, the project manager (PM) will send an email to the IT Team to initiate the project closure process. Checklist and Audits The IT Team will follow the project closure checklist, which includes audits of user GDrive and systems to ensure that all data is deleted when it is no longer needed. User Exit Checklist The IT Team will also follow the user exit checklist to delete/format user systems and check for any data that needs to be deleted.Once the IT team completes the user exit checklist, they will send a final sign-off email to the HR team, indicating that the employee exit process can proceed. Timely Implementation The IT Team will determine a timeline for implementation and assign an owner for this initiative. Best Practices Recommendation In addition to these processes, the IT Team may consider implementing best practices such as using password manager tools, periodic data audits, and establishing a data retention policy. These steps will help improve data security and minimize the risk of data breaches.

WP_CLI::add_command() is used for both internal and third-party command registration. The synopsis of a command defines which positional and associative arguments a command accepts. Let’s take a look at the synopsis for wp plugin install: wp plugin install &lt;plugin|zip|url&gt;... [--version=&lt;version&gt;] [--force] [--activate] [--activate-network]  In this example, &lt;plugin|zip|url&gt;... is the accepted positional argument. In fact, wp plugin install accepts the same positional argument (the slug, ZIP, or URL of a plugin to install) multiple times. [--version=&lt;version&gt;] is one of the accepted associative arguments. It’s used to denote the version of the plugin to install. Notice, too, the square brackets around the argument definition; square brackets mean the argument is optional. WP-CLI also has a series of global arguments which work with all commands. For instance, including --debug means your command execution will display all PHP errors, and add extra verbosity to the WP-CLI bootstrap process. Using similar approach we have created a script that installs wp, creates db, registers user, installs a plugin - activates and deactivates wp plugins via single command. Below is the script for your reference: function setup_command() { // Read the JSON file $json = file_get_contents('axioned.json'); $json_data = json_decode($json, true); $path = $json_data['path']; $ver = $json_data['version']; $dbname = $json_data['dbname']; $dbuser = $json_data['dbuser']; $dbpass = $json_data['dbpass']; $dbhost = $json_data['dbhost']; $site_url = $json_data['site_url']; $title = $json_data['title']; $admin_name = $json_data['admin_name']; $admin_password = $json_data['admin_password']; $admin_email = $json_data['admin_email']; $pluginListInstall = $json_data['pluginListInstall']; $pluginListUninstall = $json_data['pluginListUninstall']; $acf_key = $json_data['acf_key']; $axioned_theme = $json_data['axioned_theme']; WP_CLI::runcommand('core download --path=&quot;'.$path.'&quot; --version='.$ver); WP_CLI::runcommand('core config --dbname=&quot;'.$dbname.'&quot; --dbuser=&quot;'.$dbuser.'&quot; --dbpass=&quot;'.$dbpass.'&quot; --dbhost=&quot;'.$dbhost.'&quot; --dbprefix=wp_ --path=&quot;'.$path.'&quot;'); WP_CLI::runcommand('db create --path=&quot;'.$path.'&quot;'); WP_CLI::line(&quot;WordPress installation started...&quot;); WP_CLI::runcommand('core install --url=&quot;'.$site_url.'&quot; --title=&quot;'.$title.'&quot; --admin_name=&quot;'.$admin_name.'&quot; --admin_password=&quot;'.$admin_password.'&quot; --admin_email=&quot;'.$admin_email.'&quot; --path=&quot;'.$path.'&quot;'); WP_CLI::runcommand('core verify-checksums --version='.$ver.' --path=&quot;'.$path.'&quot;',['exit_error' =&gt; false]); WP_CLI::line(&quot;Plugin installation started...&quot;); install($pluginListInstall, $path, $acf_key); uninstall($pluginListUninstall, $path); WP_CLI::runcommand('plugin verify-checksums --all --path=&quot;'.$path.'&quot;', ['exit_error' =&gt; false]); WP_CLI::runcommand('theme install '.$axioned_theme.' --activate --path=&quot;'.$path.'&quot;'); WP_CLI::success('Setup Website successfully.'); } WP_CLI::add_command('setup', 'setup_command'); function install($pluginList, $path, $acf_key) { $plugCount = count($pluginList); $progress = \\WP_CLI\\Utils\\make_progress_bar('Creating Posts', $plugCount); $options = ['exit_error' =&gt; false]; foreach ($pluginList as $plug) { $name = $plug[&quot;name&quot;]; $status = ($plug[&quot;status&quot;] ? $plug[&quot;status&quot;] : &quot;&quot;); $ver = ($plug[&quot;version&quot;] ? $plug[&quot;version&quot;] : &quot;&quot;); if($name == &quot;acf-pro&quot;) { if (file_put_contents('acf-pro.zip', file_get_contents(&quot;https://connect.advancedcustomfields.com/index.php?t=$ver&amp;p=pro&amp;a=download&amp;k=$acf_key&quot;) ) ) { WP_CLI::line(&quot;ACF Pro downloaded successfully.&quot;); WP_CLI::runcommand(&quot;plugin install ./acf-pro.zip&quot;); unlink(&quot;acf-pro.zip&quot;); WP_CLI::runcommand(&quot;plugin activate advanced-custom-fields-pro&quot;); } else { WP_CLI::line(&quot;ACF Pro downloading failed.&quot;); } continue; } $cli = &quot;plugin install &quot;.$name.&quot; &quot;.($status? &quot; --activate &quot;:&quot; &quot;).($ver? &quot;--version=&quot;.$ver : &quot; &quot;).' --path=&quot;'.$path.'&quot; '; WP_CLI::runcommand($cli,$options); $progress-&gt;tick(); } $progress-&gt;finish(); WP_CLI::success($plugCount.'
