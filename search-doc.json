For example, decision records are a way for teams to think smarter and communicate better; decision records are not valuable if they're just an after-the-fact forced paperwork requirement. Some teams much prefer the name &quot;decisions&quot; over the abbreviation &quot;ADRs&quot;. When some teams use the directory name &quot;decisions&quot;, then it's as if a light bulb turns on, and the team starts putting more information into the directory, such as vendor decisions, planning decisions, scheduling decisions, etc. All of these kinds of information can use the same template. We hypothesize that people learn faster with words (&quot;decisions&quot;) over abbreviations (&quot;ADRs&quot;), and people are more motivated to write work-in-progress docs when the word &quot;record&quot; is removed, and also some developers and some managers dislike the word &quot;architecture&quot;. In theory, immutability is ideal. In practice, mutability has worked better for our teams. We insert the new info the existing ADR, with a date stamp, and a note that the info arrived after the decision. This kind of approach leads to a &quot;living document&quot; that we all can update. Typical updates are when we get information thanks to new teammates, or new offerings, or real-world results of our usages, or after-the-fact third-party changes such as vendor capabilties, pricing plans, license agreements, etc.","keywords":""},{"title":"github-actions","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/processes/delivery/Continous/github-actions","content":"github-actions TODO","keywords":""},{"title":"aws-amplify","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/processes/delivery/Continous/Managed/aws-amplify","content":"aws-amplify TODO","keywords":""},{"title":"gh-pages","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/processes/delivery/Continous/Managed/gh-pages","content":"gh-pages TODO","keywords":""},{"title":"netlify","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/processes/delivery/Continous/Managed/netlify","content":"netlify TODO","keywords":""},{"title":"go-live","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/processes/delivery/Phased/go-live","content":"go-live TODO","keywords":""},{"title":"wpengine","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/processes/delivery/Continous/Managed/wpengine","content":"wpengine","keywords":""},{"title":"regression","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/processes/delivery/Phased/regression","content":"regression TODO","keywords":""},{"title":"self-qa","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/processes/delivery/Phased/self-qa","content":"self-qa TODO","keywords":""},{"title":"backup-wpengine","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/processes/operations/Backup/backup-wpengine","content":"backup-wpengine","keywords":""},{"title":"GitHub Notifications on Slack","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/processes/observability/GithubNotifications","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Create a notifications-only channel​","type":1,"pageTitle":"GitHub Notifications on Slack","url":"docs/processes/observability/GithubNotifications#create-a-notifications-only-channel","content":"We recommend this to make sure those who need to be alerted about these (eg: developers) are always notified instantly.

Google has provided a number of tools over the years to measure and report on performance. Some developers are experts at using these tools, while others have found the abundance of both tools and metrics challenging to keep up with. Site owners should not have to be performance gurus in order to understand the quality of experience they are delivering to their users. The Web Vitals initiative aims to simplify the landscape, and help sites focus on the metrics that matter most, the Core Web Vitals. "},{"title":"Core Web Vitals​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Measuring Core Web Vitals","url":"docs/processes/performance/measuring-core-web-vitals#core-web-vitals","content":"Core Web Vitals Core Web Vitals are the subset of Web Vitals that apply to all web pages, should be measured by all site owners, and will be surfaced across all Google tools. Each of the Core Web Vitals represents a distinct facet of the user experience, is measurable in the field, and reflects the real-world experience of a critical user-centric outcome. "},{"title":"The metrics​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Measuring Core Web Vitals","url":"docs/processes/performance/measuring-core-web-vitals#the-metrics","content":"The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds): Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading.First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of 100 milliseconds or less.Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of 0.1. or less. For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. In other words, if at least 75 percent of page views to a site meet the &quot;good&quot; threshold, the site is classified as having &quot;good&quot; performance for that metric. Conversely, if at least 25 percent of page views meet the &quot;poor&quot; threshold, the site is classified as having &quot;poor&quot; performance. So, for example, a 75th percentile LCP of 2 seconds is classified as &quot;good&quot;, while a 75th percentile LCP of 5 seconds is classified as &quot;poor&quot;.
