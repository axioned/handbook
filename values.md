# PRDXN's Core Values

When we use the expression “PRDXN’s Core Values” we mean the behaviours, attitudes and standards we would like each and everyone of us to:
- Value in our colleagues
- Use as our “guiding light” for how we should behave and operate in the PRDXN workplace/with others
- Compare ourselves against, at all times, no matter how Junior and/or Senior we may be

The dictionary definition of “values” that we’re referring to here is: “principles or standards of behaviour; one's judgement of what is important in life.”
